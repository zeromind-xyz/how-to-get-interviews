This playbook covers the art of getting interviews - for software engineers.

The first draft of this playbook was written in 2019 for friends. It's helped dozens folks land jobs at Big Tech companies and startups of all sizes in the Bay Area.

The world has changed greatly since 2019. From the perspective of getting employed as a software engineer, the number of opportunities available for people who don't live in Tech hubs has skyrocketed with remote work accepted in mainstream work cultures. Yet, Big Tech just went through a sizeable round of layoffs with hiring freezes for the foreseeable future in anticipation of a recession and slowed growth in Tech.

I've revamped this playbook to take into account these changes. In this market, in addition to having the right technical skills, it's increasingly important to know how to successfully earn interviews.

As I saw in 2019, and continue to see today, most people don't understand the art of getting interviews. Most playbooks are focused on how to crack technical interviews, solve coding puzzles, etc. but **the most common failure isn't in failing an interview, it's not getting one in the first place.**

In this playbook I'll show you how hiring works and how to leverage that knowledge to maximize the interviews you get. (If you're more interested in a guide for how to pass a technical interview / screen, then skip to the "Resources" section that has links to some great guides that I highly recommend).

I've tried my best to leave out opinions on where you ought to work at. That's an important, nuanced topic that's worthy of its own playbook and outside the scope of this one.

This playbook is **free and will always be free**. 

By working hard to build a career that brings you happiness & peace - you will have made this a worthwhile effort for me.

All the best!
