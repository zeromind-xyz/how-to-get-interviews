If you can engage someone for 3 seconds, they're willing to spend another 30s
If you can engage someone for 30s, they're willing to spend a half hour.

The greatest hurdle is getting past the 3 second mark. You need to have something impressive up front to be able to hold attention. Most of your failures to impress will happen in the first 3 seconds.

No one has patience to spend more than 3 seconds on you if you fail to impress them.

This is why the best pitches, product descriptions, landing pages, resumes, etc. are **presented in layers**: Best highlight up front and center to get people past the 3s mark, then a slightly more granular pitch that can be understood in 30s, and THEN a detailed presentation of your idea now that you know you have the audience's attention.
