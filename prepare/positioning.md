# Positioning

There are multiple "flavors" of software engineers. The most popular types you'll see are:
- Product engineers
- Generalist / full-stack software engineers

Companies at times will explicitly define which flavor they're looking for in the name of the role "e.g. Product engineer" itself or sometimes implicitly in the job description itself:
- Roles that lean towards product engineering use phrases like: "have product sense", "own features end-to-end", "engage with users", etc.
- Roles that lean towards generalist software engineering use phrases like: "high quality code", "quality testing", "scalable", etc.

Every asset (resume, pitch, project, website) you prepare ought to be tailored for what your audience wants. If you spend time talking about your interesting marketing strategies to get users for an app you built, but the role actually calls for building robust, scalable systems to serve images to millions of users, then you might be better off talking about some of the architecture / system challenges in building your app instead.

- Flavors of job listings.
	- Explicitly defined in name of role
	- Implicitly understood based on the type of company.
- This impacts which aspects of your experiences that you highlight. You don't even need to change the project descriptions, etc, but you can selectively choose which part of your story to tell.
	- The act of choosing what to tell -> storytelling: and that's where positioning comes into the picture.
