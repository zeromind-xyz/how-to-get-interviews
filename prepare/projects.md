# Projects
- What is a project?
- How can it help you get interviews
	- And how it helps you actually do well on interviews.
- Present your project like a real-world product - as much as possible. The closer your work aligns with the kind of work that succeeds in the world, the more impressive your project is.
- How to position and "showcase" your project like an actual product:
	- Position as a product that is designed to have users -> not just a personal research project / some other academic projects, becuase most people evaluating you won't know how to gauge the impressiveness of academic accomplishments.
	- **Landing page** (changes based on the flavor of your product):
		- Software library
		- Mobile app
		- Web app
- Build a deep understanding of every aspect of your product: 
	- **simple, succinct definition of what you made**: don't use flowery language, make it almost stupidly to the point. Reading this description should enable a reader to literally visualize what you created and the complexity of it.
	- **origin story** (how / why you came up with the idea to build it)
	- **product management**: why did you choose to build it with the particular features you did, and what was your decision making process here?
	- **engineering**: How did you actually build it? What tools and technologies did you use? What were your greatest roadblocks while building it?
	- **collaboration**: Did you work with someone on it? How did you convince them to help out? What did you use to collaborate? How did you resolve conflict with them?
	- **getting users**
	- **iteration**: 
- An example: a note taking application 
- Know the answers to these questions about your project:
	- kd
	- kf
	- j
	- 
- What to do if you don't have a project that is good enough to market this way? Depends on your previous work experience: if you haven't worked at a reputed company / went to a renowned computer science program (in the eyes of the companies you're applying to), you're not going to hear back. In that case, it makes sense to spend time working on a project that clearly demonstrates your competence to the world. Not only will it make getting interviews easier, but it will enable you to get interviews at **better companies**.
