# Projects

A project is something you've built: an application (web, mobile, command line, etc.), software library.

When pitched well, projects can be a powerful way to demonstrate your competence to get interviews, and also a great way to do well in interviews: because in addition to programming problems, you'll have a lot of time during interviews to discuss your previous work.

Projects can be especially great tools for those that haven't worked at a reputed company, and for those looking to change roles (e.g. "software engineer" -> "machine learning engineer", etc.). When you're looking to change roles, and your past experiences don't directly demonstrate competence for the new role, your project gives you the opportunity to demonstrate your ability to do the work that you're aiming to do in your next role.

Unlike work experience, crafting a project is permission-less: no one can stop you and it's entirely in your hands.

The most impressive projects create value: they're used by other people (even if a few). Having users legitimizes a product: it demonstrates a range of skills: 
- ability to **build** something that works well enough to be used (you'd be surprised how rare this skill is).
- ability to **ship** something useful (most people are stuck in the planning, design phases and rarely ship something.)
- ability to **communicate** your product to others well enough to get people to use it.

These are impressive skills to have and correlate with being able to create value as a software engineer at most companies.

When a project doesn't have users, doubt creeps into the minds of people evaluating you because it's incredibly easy to put together a few screens and "demo" something that looks like a product but actually doesn't work. By simply sending a video of a demo, or a link to a codebase, you make it really difficult for hiring managers to gauge the actual value of your work, and in most of these cases, your project will be ignored.

**You should present your project as an actual product in the real world, instead of some kind of class project / academic project that looks really different from the kinds of products that companies build**. From a company's perspective, it's easier to gauge your skills when you've built something that they can understand, vs. some kind of fancy research project that requires reading a paper to make sense of it.

You also don't need more than one impressive project! In fact, I think it helps to focus and create one stellar project, rather than have two average ones. You can spend the time and effort to craft a project that serves as an effective sales pitch for your abilities.

Your project doesn't have to be "big"! E.g.: a simple tool to quickly search all open classes at your college that's used by 1000 students is WAY more impressive than some fancy sounding "Sub 3ms page loading optimizer built in Rooby" that's used by and appreciated by no one. 

Don't underestimate the impressiveness of **simple ideas that have users.**

### How to showcase a project

You should communicate your project in multiple ways:
1. A landing page: a website that pitches your product **to potential users of your product**.
2. Demo: an easy way to try it out.
3. A compelling story.

### Landing page
Your landing page consists of your copy (written information that pitches your product), and visual design (layout, colors, font sizes, font colors, video placements, etc.).

The audience for your landing page is the USERS of your project, not the engineers / recruiters at the companies that you're applying to (unless they happen to be part of the target users for your product).

The main section of a landing page is the "Hero": the section of the landing page your users first encounter before they start scrolling down. This is the first thing they see, and therefore is the most important aspect of your landing page. If you can't clearly communicate what your product does in the Hero, assume no one will scroll past it.

The most important aspects of your landing page is what you say, and how you show your product. With high quality screenshots / designs and well crafted words you're 90% of the way to having a powerful landing page. 

I'll provide a simple template here for your landing page - which you can use for any kind of project: product / open source library. You can build on top of this and freely borrow ideas from great landing pages out there (referenced below). 

Basic product landing page template
1. Hero
2. Social proof
3. Features
4. Call to action (link to download / try your product)

**Hero**
1. Heading
2. Sub-heading: a clear description of what your product does. 
3. Screenshot / video / GIF, etc.

The heading is the main "value proposition" for your product: makes it clear WHY your product is useful.

The sub-heading is a clear description of what your product does. Avoid using fancy sounding words that have no substance (e.g. "that will transform your life"). Each word should aid in creating an understanding in the reader for what exactly your product does.

Then SHOW your product as best as you can through screenshots, GIFs, videos, or even a live, embedded version of your app that users can play with right then and there.

If your product is a user interface component, I highly recommend embedding it into your landing page so that people can play with it right then and there. If your product is an API / software library, consider embedding a dummy mock "environment" that animates typing out example code, "running it" and showing results. (https://stripe.com does this really well on their landing page).

You can learn a lot by analyzing existing, successful products in the same domain as your project and freely borrowing ideas from them. Don't worry, the entire Tech industry is built on buliding on top of others' ideas. You won't be looked down upon by taking a presentation formula that works and applying it to your own project, on the other hand it'll help give legitimacy to your project because its pitched in a way that the best products are pitched. Remember, your goal ought to be to clearly communicate a useful product... not necessarily to appear "novel"

**Social proof**
Proof that people value your product. This can be via:
- app store likes
- Github stars
- User testimonials
etc.

**Social proof is the most direct, impactful way to demonstrate that you have users for your product.** 

The more trustworthy the source the better. For example: app store likes and Github stars are powerful becuase it's tough to make those up: actual other users have to perform an action on those platforms to generate the likes.

If you're using testimonials, try to capture them on Twitter / YT / etc and aggregate them in your landing page. This way each testimonial can be verified on platforms that are trusted, rather than simply taking your word for them. You can also use tools like: [https://testimonial.to/](https://testimonial.to) to aggregate testimonials and embed into your landing page, or you can just manually embed tweets (which is free and probably the best way to get started - unless you have a ton of testimonials).

Because social proof is the most important validation of your product, you should have some social proof in the hero itself. Let's say you have tens of reviews on the app store with 5 stars, you should mention that in the hero: perhaps as a link to the app store with the words "Users love us!", or "dozens of 5 star reviews!".

Or you could perhaps stick one or two testimonials in the hero, with a wall of testmonials below after you scroll.

There are multiple ways to do this, but whichever way you choose your goal is to show that you have users who love your product - quickly.

**Features**
Once someone has understood the value of your product and what it does exactly, they're ready for a deeper understanding of its features.

Your project likely doesn't have many features, and that's fine. Most projects can be communicated with 3 or less features. 

Each feature presentation can simply be a screenshot + one line description of what it is. That's all you need.

**Call to action**

The "call to action" is a prominent button that represents the main action you want the user to perform on your landing page. For many of you it'll be: "Try now", or the standard Apple / Google "Download app" buttons.

Without a call to action, a visitor won't have a clear understanding of what to do next. You want to minimize the mental processing / decision making a visitor does becuase any thinking is friction. Minimize friction by nudging users to take the actions that you believe will benefit them: e.g. trying out your app.

### Case studies

<figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgxdbpyfy/image/upload/v1671304535/Be-real-landing-page_scgrxc.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

(landing page for the BeReal mobile app).

Captivating main line: "Your Friends for Real". It quickly helps you understand the value of this product: unlike existing social media platforms where people show "fake" versions of themselves, this is an app where people are "real". Powerful.

The sub heading literally just says what the app does: "Every day at a different time, everyone is notified simultaneously to capture and share a Photo in 2 Minutes.". No fancy sounding words that have no substance. Reading this makes it abundantly clear what the app does.

Clear screenshots of their app on the right side with a few words explaining the feature shown in the screenshot. 

See how simple the landing page is? There are no crazy animations, no colors popping everywhere. Simple words, clear screenshots, links to download the app. Minimal, beautiful fonts. That's it!

**Other great examples**
More applications that I highly recommend studying:
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) (web app)
	- Clear heading ("One workspace. Every team"), and Sub-heading ("Weâ€™re more than a doc. Or a table. Customize Notion to work the way you do"). You get a sense for what the product offers. Coupled with the clear screenshot in the hero, I see that the product lets me create a wiki / knowledge base for my entire team.
- (Front-end component open source library):
	- Font-end projects are great because you can literally show the end product: people should be able to play with the component you created. If they can't yet, then spend time to present it in a way that can be used.
	- Use a tool like [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to SHOW the actual UI component that you built).
- [Nango.dev](https://www.nango.dev/): (non-UI software library or API):
	- Heading: "# The easiest way to sync data from 3rd party APIs", Sub-heading: "Nango syncs data from 3rd party APIs to your local DB and keeps it up to date. It's open-source, self-contained and you can try it in 3 minutes". Easy to follow, clear what this product does.
	- I also appreciated that they put a one line code snippet right in the hero to demonstrate exactly how to use their library. It communicates simplicity (one line to sync with an API endpoint).
	- They have large buttons in the hero linking to their [Github repo](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango) that also has a detailed Readme page describing thier library in greater detail (more examples and clear screenshots).
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-in) (API / library product). The golden standard for how to present an API product. Take careful notice of their demos in the landing page itself that makes it abundantly clear how to use their API in a programming environment and even the type of results to expect from hitting an API endpoint.

You can find more pages for products that did well across a variety of categories at: [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products?order=best_rated&period=2022-12&topic=web-app) - go to the landing pages and study how they present their products.

### Demo
I recommend having both:
- Video overview
- Playable demo

A video overview is usually a < 1 minute long video with you presenting your product. Great examples:
- [Loom](https://www.loom.com/share/9edb010ba5344833b48ef281380cedaa)
- [Retool](https://retool.com/)

A playable demo lets users actually play with your product.
- Consider throwing a widget in the landing page with dummy data.
- Use tools like [Appetize](https://appetize.io/) to embed your mobile app into your landing page.
- Make sure to bypass any login / signup forms, etc. and prepopulate with any data required to make the interaction meaningful. For example: if an article annotation app, start with some existing articles in the demo so that the user can open it up and start highlighting right way.
- Nudge the user towards the actions you want them to take. If your app interaction isn't straightforward, build into your app an onboarding flow so that users aren't confused about what to do.
- TEST WITH YOUR FRIENDS! Don't have a broken demo. Please.

If your playable demo isn't embeddable on the landing page itself (which is usually best suited for user interface component libraries), you can have a button on the landing page titled "Try now" with the caption "No signup required" that opens a new tab with the playable demo of your app open.

Whatever your choice, do your best to minimize the friction in getting someone to actually try out your project (TODO: move this point to the intro bec. it's super fucking important).

### Story
OK, let's now assume you have a project that demonstrates your competence, and you've 
followed the guidelines above to present it effectively via a landing page, and you have an
effective demo.

These 2 assets are created for potential users as the target audience, not potential employers.

Now it's to craft a story with the audience as your potential employer to effectively communicate your thinking about your project: i.e. why you built it, what problem you're trying to solve, how you went about getting users and growing it, challenges you faced along the way, etc.

Use the 3-act structure:
1. Act 1: Setup
2. Act 2: Confrontation
3. Act 3: Resolution

Your setup is the origin story for your project: what problem did you face that led you to create this project? What are the existing solutions out there? Why weren't they good enough for you? Who did you create this for?

The confrontation is about the challenges you faced to bring your project to life. It could be that the first version you built wasn't used by anyone, and by talking to your users you learned that they value something else entirely and so you scrapped your current direction to build something people actually want.

Or your confrontation could involve engineering challenges you had while building your product that forced you to explore different ways of doing things because your initial system architecture wasn't feasible and you realized only after you had started building.

Everyone has some challenge or the other when building something and getting people to use it. By sharing the issues you faced & how you overcame them, you'll be able to not only demonstrate how you deal with challenges, but you also make it easier for people you're engaging with to connect with you.

Every single person that's built something meaningful has gone through many challenges: from fixing really tough bugs, learning new tools and languages, to getting products in the hands of actual users, and much more. Shared challenges are what bring us together, so don't hesitate to articulate what you went through to bulid your project.

Resolution is about what you've achieved through this process: usually in the form of creating value for others by solving the problem that pushed you to create this project in the first place. 

Of course when building software there's no neatly defined "goal" or "conclusion". it's a process of continuous improvement. So communicate your "resolution" as reaching a milestone you set out to reach, while still communicating the roadmap ahead of you to improve your project.

Always have a future roadmap for your project - even if you never get around to it. It gives you a chance to showcase your ability to prioritize work on a project - a critical skill for any engineer.

When prioritizing features to build, once again, do your best to tie it to outcomes. Fixing a bug because your app keeps crashing for a set of users is a much higher priority than adding a feature because you want to use the feature as an opportunity to try out a new library. By showing that you're constantly prioritizing the users of your product over scratching random learning itches you have, you'll demonstrate strong judgement. 

### Choosing a project
Features of the ideal project:
- Something that you'd use yourself (this helps you understand the problem you're trying to solve much better, AND you have your first user ready to use your product when it's ready).
- Solves an actual problem.
- Can be used by others (i.e. an actual playable demo, vs. just screenshots / just a research paper without an implementation).
- First version can be built in a couple of weeks.
- Uses popular languages and frameworks
- Something that you can get feedback from users quickly (e.g. if you're a college student, then building something for students means getting feedback is straightforward: they're right next to you! On the other hand, building a product for large companies means it's tough to get your work in front of them, and leads to a much longer process).

### Questions to answer
Be prepared to answer any question about your project. Some common questions:
- Why did you build this project? What problem were you trying to solve?
- Is there anyone else besides you using this? If so, how do they feel about it?
- What challenges did you face in bringing this to life?
- If you could start from scratch, what would you do differently?
- What technology stack did you pick? Why?
- Did you work with anyone else on this? How did you divide up the work? Did you face any challenges working with them?
- What are your next steps with your project? Are there any more features you're working on? Bugs? Marketing efforts?
- How do you typically build? What was your process to turn your initial, rough, idea into this working project that's used by others?
- Did you design this product? What tools did you use? What process did you follow?
