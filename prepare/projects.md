# Projects
- You have to present this project like a real-world product - as much as possible. The closer your work aligns with the kind of work that succeeds in the world, the more impressive your project is.
- The power of having an impressive project -> what it can do for your job hunting process (and personal confidence). -> both to help you get interviews and ace them.
- How to position and "showcase" your project like an actual product:
	- Position as a product that is designed to have users -> not just a personal research project / some other academic projects, becuase most people evaluating you won't know how to gauge the impressiveness of academic accomplishments.
	- **Landing page** (changes based on the flavor of your product):
		- Software library
		- Mobile app
		- Web app
