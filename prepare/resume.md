Your resume (CV) is a one page document that demonstrates your competence for the role that you're applying to. It's a sales pitch, not a laundry list of everything you've ever done.

Your resume ideally isn't the first things companies look at to determine whether to give you an interview (the best way to get interviews is through referrals), but it's almost guaranteed that people (recruiters, hiring managers, founders, engineers) will look at your resume as you move along in the hiring process at a company.

Write your resume assuming the reader won't spend more than 15 seconds on it. Even that's a generous estimate. You have to demonstrate competence right off the bat.

In addition to demonstrating competence, you have to **minimize your perceived risk**. 
(But what does that mean?)

As we discussed earlier, interviewing a bad candidate is expensive, and accidentally hiring an incompetent software engineer is terrible for a company, therefore a company is often willing to pass up interviewing someone that might be a gem, but is risky, and choose to interview the safe bet.

(TODO: expand on this, or remove this train of thought if it's not building up to something).

### Organization
1. Name, contact, socials (at the top, taking up minimal real estate and out of the way).
2. Experiences (i.e. "highlight reel")
4. Education
5. Technologies (Maybe)

The meat of your resume is the **Experiences**: jobs and projects that you've worked on. This should be up front and center.

It's actually a negative signal if you put anything above your highlight reel. It's tempting to put your education credentials up front, but what message does that send? That attending college is your most impressive accomplishment, not the work you've done / projects you've built? 

If you really don't have anything else to show besides your college education, and you didn't go to a well known college, it's worth spending a few weeks building something that you can showcase as your primary experience. Having a project that you understand inside out and can talk about for hours (about how you designed, developed, deployed, got users, etc.) will help you get more interviews and help you greatly during interviews (read more at: [[projects]]).

### Work experience
The most powerful signal is experience working at a reputed company.

Software engineering is a more than writing great code or solving programming puzzles. You have to work in a team to ship features, fix bugs, design systems, prioritize roadmaps, sustainably over months & years, while collaborating with other teams and departments to ensure that what you're working in is actually creating value for users / customers.

A handful of interviews often aren't enough to really assess your ability to do all of these things. Even if you're able to solve technical problems & pass your interviews, the company still sees a risk in hiring you.

This is why experience in an environment known for great software engineering counts so much: if you've worked a year or two at such an environment, you're far more likely to be an effective engineer... at least compared to someone without that experience who can only solve Leetcode questions really well.

What's a "reputed" company? This depends on the strength of the company's engineering brand: how highly software engineers view the engineering competence of that company. 

For example, if you worked at Google, that's a company that everyone knows & is reputed no matter where you apply to. But let's say you worked at Razorpay (popular company in India) and are applying to company in Europe, they might not have heard of Razorpay, so it would help to add in parentheses how significant this company is to those without context -> e.g. "Razorpay (India's #1 payment gateway)".

What you consider reputed, or valuable, the company you're applying to might not, so be careful not to just name drop without thinking about whether the names you're dropping are actually valuable. If in doubt, assume the reader doesn't know about your company and think about how to communicate 

### Projects

### Design
- Design philosophy: used to emphasize what's important: humans don't just scan by reading every single thing top to bottom, they scan visually. Good design nudges eyes towards what you want them to focus on.
	- Understanding primary (immediately relevant information) & secondary (can be used after the first pass / if the reader is convinced they want to spend more time on your resume).
- Alignment
- Fonts
- Colors
- Spacing
- Links

### What to avoid
- Objective (usually a short sentence / blurb at the top describing yourself and the role you're looking for). This usually doesn't add value because which position you're applying to can be understood in other ways (from the application and from your experiences) & takes away prime real estate at the top. And sometimes people tend to use phrases like "fast learner", or "great communicator", or "product obsessed", or some other nice sounding phrase to describe themselves. That's worthless. Your experiences should paint that picture about yourself.
- Don't say anything to the effect of "great communicator", or "proficient in English". These communicate the exact opposite. Saying is weak. Show: demonstrate your communication skills by communicating your pitch effectively.
- Avoid jargon - and especially if it's specific to your company.
- Minimize decorations on links: it highlights the wrong thing.
- You don't need more than one page for your resume. No matter how much experience you have. Seriously. As you gain experience, your resume should in fact become more concise. The best resume is not needing a resume at all. The next best resume is a one-liner, e.g. "Built Acme.xyz and scaled to 1 million users, generating $X revenue.". Remember, your job is to demonstrate competence, not list out everything you've ever done. Your resume is a pitch.
- Avoid pictures of yourself unless legally required because it introduces unnecessary bias.
