Your resume (CV) is a one page document that demonstrates your competence for the role that you're applying to. It's a sales pitch, not a laundry list of everything you've ever done.

Your resume, ideally, isn't the first things companies look at to determine whether to give you an interview (the best way to get interviews is through referrals), but it's almost guaranteed that people (recruiters, hiring managers, founders, engineers) will look at your resume as you move along in the hiring process at a company to see if you're a good fit and to determine which questions to ask you during interviews.

Write your resume assuming the reader won't spend more than 15 seconds on it. Even that's a generous estimate. You have to demonstrate competence right off the bat.

As we discussed earlier, interviewing a bad candidate is expensive, and accidentally hiring an incompetent software engineer is terrible for a company, therefore a company is often willing to pass up interviewing someone that might be a gem, but is risky, and choose to interview the safer bet.

### Organization
1. Name, contact, socials (at the top, taking up minimal real estate and out of the way).
2. Experiences (i.e. "highlight reel")
3. Education
4. Technologies (Maybe)

(TODO: update image reference).

The meat of your resume is the **Experiences**: jobs and projects that you've worked on. This should be up front and center.

It's actually a negative signal if you put anything above your highlight reel. It's tempting to put your education credentials up front, but what message does that send? That attending college is your most impressive accomplishment, not the work you've done / projects you've built? 

If you really don't have anything else to show besides your college education, and you didn't go to a well known college, it's worth spending a few weeks building something that you can showcase as your primary experience. Having a project that you understand inside out and can talk about for hours (about how you designed, developed, deployed, got users, etc.) will help you get more interviews and do well in them (read more at: [[projects]]).

Some folks prefer to have their projects as part of a separate section in their resume, but it's also fine to include as part of your experiences. The distinction between projects and experience isn't that rigid: your goal is to demonstrate competence and it could very well be the case that one of your projects does a better job than one of your past work experiences, in that case you ought to place the impressive project above that work experience. If you have separate sections for work experience and projects, you can no longer re-arrange according to impressiveness, which isn't helpful.

### Work experience

Software engineering is a more than writing great code or solving programming puzzles. You have to work in a team to ship features, fix bugs, design systems, prioritize roadmaps, sustainably over months & years, while collaborating with other teams and departments to ensure that what you're working in is actually creating value for users / customers.

A handful of interviews often aren't enough to really assess your ability to do all of these things. Even if you're able to solve technical problems & pass your interviews, the company still sees a risk in hiring you.

This is why experience in an environment known for great software engineering counts so much: if you've worked a year or two at such an environment, you're far more likely to be an effective engineer... at least compared to someone without that experience who can only solve Leetcode questions really well.

"Strong reputation" is the strength of the company's engineering brand: how highly software engineers view the engineering competence of that company. 

For example, Google is a company with a strong engineering brand that'll help you get interviews at most Tech companies. But let's say you worked at Razorpay (popular company in India), then companies you're applying to in Europe might not know of Razorpay, or underestimate Razorpay's reputation (which has an exceptional reputation in India). In this case it would help to include context that nudges the reader to understand / acknowledge the brand's reputation, or at the very least do a bit more research to validate the claim: e.g. instead of just listing the company name "Razorpay" in your resume, it would help to say: "Razorpay (India's #1 payment gateway)".

Similarly if you worked at a company with a high reputation in Atlanta, Georgia, and are applying to companies in San Francisco, you should what context you can provide to help a reader from San Francisco gauge the reputation of the company brand.

Potential contexts you can use:
- Ranking in a category for that region: e.g. "#1 payment gateway in India", "2nd largest e-commerce player in Thailand", etc.
- Annual recurring revenue (how much money the company makes every year on a recurring basis) - usually applicable for startups that aren't yet well known. 
- Investor: If a popular VC firm that's known in the region you're applying to has invested in this company, then consider including it as context. E.g: "Acme Corp (Series B led by a16z)". A quick Google should help you uncover your company's fundraising round and which investor led that round.

### How to describe an experience
1. Company name
2. Title
3. Date range
4. Description (bullet points)

Your title actually doesn’t matter that much unless it was at a company that people understand the criteria for each title. For example, if you say that, you’re a senior software engineer at a start up that no one’s ever heard of, then people aren’t going to be able to place a value to the senior part of your title because they don’t even know the criteria for an engineer at that company.

**Associate your actions with outcomes**.

The description is where you demonstrate competence. Organize it as bullet points: one for each main action & outcome you generated at the company. Connecting actions to outcomes is important because the outcomes you can generate for a company is what makes you desirable for that company, not necessarily the actions you take.

An outcome can be:
- a **direct** business outcome, such as an increase in users or revenue. 
- an **indirect** outcome, such as improving the efficiency of a user experience, which will indirectly, hopefully, increase revenue / users later.

It’s tempting to try and craft an outcome for every action that you took at a company, but it doesn’t make sense in certain situations. For example, if, say you wrote documentation for an internal software package, and you try to tie that to a 27% increase in productivity or some increase in revenue because your team was able to move faster, that's really stretching it. Not only does your point come off as naive, the reader will likely, subconsciously, discredit everything elsey you say.

Examples:
- Worked in team of 3 engineers to build a search API that currently enables 10M customers / month, across 20 countries, to search support documentation. Responsible for documentation, search results localization, and 20% of API functionality.
- Handles 1m concurrent API calls with **0.6 second response time** at for **99 percentile average.**

Some popular categories of outcomes:
- Users
- Revenue
- Performance
- Scalability

**Reduce ambiguity**

E.g. "increased revenue by 30% over a quarter" doesn't mean much if the revenue went from $10 -> $13. Provide all the context required to clearly, without ambiguity, make sense of the outcome you created.

If you created something that "was used by 1000" customers, what does "use" mean? That they downloaded the app and forgot about it? Or were they spending time in it every day? Or did it help them make money for themselves? Be more specific. -> "built (abc) that gained **1000 daily active users w/ 1 hour average session time**".
 
**Minimize doubt over your specific contribution**

Saying "worked in team of 3 engineers to build a search API that currently enables 10M customers / month, across 20 countries" on its own doesn't tell the reader what YOU did as part of that team. This leaves room for doubt: someone could interpret this as you potentially just writing a few test cases & calling yourself a contributor.

Break open the task and describe what YOU did:
- "Worked in team of 3 engineers to build a search API that currently enables 10M customers / month, across 20 countries, to search support documentation. **Responsible for documentation, search results localization, and 20% of API functionality.**"

**Link to blogs / press for your work**

Social proof is powerful. Having your work published on the company's engineering blog / video can help build credibility for what you've worked on, and make it easier for a reader to understand what you did in depth.

Make sure to link to any coverage that can help a reader get a better sense of what you worked on. In some cases this isn't possible (proprietary and company won't talk about it). 

If you worked on a cool project at a company that they haven't shared with the world yet (from an engineering standpoint), you could propose to your company to write that blogpost for them. Companies often love sharing their engineering achievements with the world to attract great engineers to join their company. But this marketing effort often falls to the side because of other priorities. You could be the one to take up this task to create value for the company, and have a way to tangibly showcase what you worked on there.

**Making your team better counts!**

If you've written documentation / guides / playbooks / etc, or did something to make your team better, it's worth including. Software engineering is a team sport. While it's tough to tangibly quantify the impact of your work, you can use metrics such as the number of people that read your guide as a way to communicate indirect impact.

Briefly go over the contents of what you created so your reader has a sense of the knowledge you have on that subject.

**Use simple language.**

What not to write:

"Dynamically communicate prospective opportunities and proactive technologies. Efficiently aggregate interactive materials before state of the art collaboration and idea-sharing. Credibly supply cross-media metrics via leading-edge solutions.  
  
Seamlessly embrace world-class imperatives and technically sound best practices. Black belt parallelization of prospective relationships via tactical leadership skills. Enthusiastically productivate customer directed core competencies via impactful functionalities."

(ref: Patrick Collison's parody LinkedIn page).

Cut this type of BS. "best practices", "leadership skills", "cutting-edge". It makes you sound incompetent.

### Projects
Projects are incredibly effective tools to demonstrate competence - when presented well. (Read chapter on Projects before working it into your resume: <>).

In your resume, use the same principles that you used to describe work experience to describe your projects: highlight your most important actions and connect them to outcomes.

Once again, actions without outcomes might look / sound cool, but isn't impressive from the perspective of a hiring manager at a company you're applying to.

Format:
1. Project name w/ context
2. Your title
3. Date range
4. Description (bullet points)

It's important to provide context for what your project is at a high level (e.g. software library, mobile app, web app, AI face generator, etc), because a project name on its own likely means nothing to the reader, so you should give the reader enough context to build an intuition for what it could be about, before digging into the details.

E.g. "Bingo! (web app to create custom bingo cards)".

Link your project title to the project itself: either its landing page, or a page on your website that describes your project in detail (read more in [[projects]] & [[website]]). You should definitely link to your project: unlike a company work experience, you likely don't have confidentiality challenges in directly linking to your project.

Therefore, not linking to the actual project creates doubt in the reader's mind over whether you actually built it. **Always be minimizing doubt!**

There's no need to use fancy sounding titles like "CEO / Founder" for side projects that weren't widely used and projects that you didn't fully commit to for an extended period of time (or raised money for, etc.). If your project seems like a nice side project, not a significant effort that spanned months / years, then by calling yourself a founder / CEO you come off as naive. Just call yourself a "Creator" / "Co-creator" for your project.

The project description is in the same format as your work experience description: bullet points tying actions to outcomes (when the outomes make sense).

In projects you're less likely to have tangible outcomes when compared to your work experiences.

Impressive aspects of your project that are worth pitching:
- Usage 
	- Actual, daily active users
	- Downloads / installs
	- Github stars
- Technical complexity (what you built)
- How you got users (very interesting - need to expand on this).
- Novelty
- Great user experience (show don't tell)
- Great marketing / communication skills (show don't tell).

### Design
- Design philosophy: used to emphasize what's important: humans don't just scan by reading every single thing top to bottom, they scan visually. Good design nudges eyes towards what you want them to focus on.
	- Understanding primary (immediately relevant information) & secondary (can be used after the first pass / if the reader is convinced they want to spend more time on your resume).
- Alignment
- Fonts
- Colors
- Spacing
- Links

### What to avoid
- Objective (usually a short sentence / blurb at the top describing yourself and the role you're looking for). This usually doesn't add value because which position you're applying to can be understood in other ways (from the application and from your experiences) & takes away prime real estate at the top. And sometimes people tend to use phrases like "fast learner", or "great communicator", or "product obsessed", or some other nice sounding phrase to describe themselves. That's worthless. Your experiences should paint that picture about yourself.
- Don't say anything to the effect of "great communicator", or "proficient in English". These communicate the exact opposite. Saying is weak. Show: demonstrate your communication skills by communicating your pitch effectively.
- Avoid jargon - and especially if it's specific to your company.
- Minimize decorations on links: it highlights the wrong thing.
- You don't need more than one page for your resume. No matter how much experience you have. Seriously. As you gain experience, your resume should in fact become more concise. The best resume is not needing a resume at all. The next best resume is a one-liner, e.g. "Built Acme.xyz and scaled to 1 million users, generating $X revenue.". Remember, your job is to demonstrate competence, not list out everything you've ever done. Your resume is a pitch.
- Avoid pictures of yourself unless legally required because it introduces unnecessary bias.
- You should have exactly ZERO spelling / grammatical errors. There are enough tools out there. You have no excuses.

### Company specific 
?? -> startups, Big Tech, legacy companies.

----

Consider adding:
- Tailor resume to the company you're applying to (and walk through the possible ways to tailor).
