Literally can be a Notion page with the right information.

- A "homepage" for you. Similar to your resume, this isn't a place to just dump all your projects without thought. Place your main project, accomplishment up front and center.
- You do NOT need a fancy looking website. It's about what you say and show!
	- Literally just make a Notion page. That's it.
- Opening para
	- Links to projects.
- Project page
	- Description
	- Outcomes
	- How you built it
	- Social proof.
- Links to writing / any content you've created.

Yeah, there's a lot of thought to put into this one. Amen.
