Your website serves as an aggregator: a place where someone can go to gain a much deeper understanding of you and your work.

You'll be linking to your website in your email signatures, and in follow-ups during communication. While your website likely won't be the first thing someone sees, it's an important guide for when someone is willing to spend more time to understand you.

Your website doesn't have to be fancy at all. In fact, if you don't already have a personal website, I'd recommend just creating a simple Notion page with a personalized domain (e.g. janedoe.notionsite.com) (https://www.notion.so/blog/personalize-public-pages). That's all you need.

Following the 3s-30s-30m rule, you want to communicate yourself in the following order:
1. A single sentence that communicates your abilities quickly.
2. A blurb (a short description, usually a paragraph or two).
3. Links to subpages for projects
4. External links to essays, videos, Twitter, Github repos, etc. Ranked by impressiveness.

**One-liner**

What is the most impressive outcome you've created? 

- "I've worked at Acme (link to company) & Bacme as a software engineer shipping 3 products that directly increased revenue 3-fold (over $1M)".
- "I designed, developed and marketed a note-taking app (link to app) that's actively used and loved by dozens of daily users".

Mention the most impressive **outcome** for your work, and make sure to link to your project (or company if a previous work experience was your highlight).

**Blurb**

Your blurb is a couple of sentences outlining more of your previous work and your motivations. Your blurb follows your one-liner. It's perfectly alright to not have 2 more sentences to add.

- "I've also worked on a handful of web and mobile projects, and write essays at the intersection of Tech, culture, politics (over 10k unique reads)".

**Links**
- Projects
- Link to all of your creations across platforms: videos, essays, tweets, etc.
- Resume

**Personality**

Humanize yourself. (But why is this important?)

- What have you read recently?
- Things outside of Tech (if you have any interests).

**Putting it all together**
