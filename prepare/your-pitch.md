Going to reference the "assets" you create here through the rest of the playbook. This chapter basically summarizes all of your assets in one place - enabling you to present it effectively. Amen.

Following the 3-30-30 rule:
1. One-liner (3s)
2. Blurb (30s)
3. Links for more (30m).

Explain and show each and every one of these. And reference the assets created earlier.

Through all the "approaches" chapter, will reference this chapter to determine what to say.
