What does a company need to see to even give you the interview in the first place?

Well, they want to know if you'd be great at the job. But evaluating this directly is very time consuming and difficult to do. The only way to truly understand someone's competence is by working with them over a long period of time (say, a project).

Because software engineering is far more involved than solving self-contained coding puzzles. It's also a team sport: and a person's ability to make their team more effective is also positively contributing to the bottom line.

But obviously companies can't spend all that time and effort to evaluate a candidate, so they look for "signals" of competence that correlate with actual competence, which saves them a lot of time and effort.

Look at the following "resumes":

"Created the first prototype of Gmail, successfully launched it internally, and eventually led the team to scaling the product to 1 million users." [x]. I mean if we rule out outright lying (which is easier than you think) then there's really no doubt in this candidate's ability. Not only did they successfully build a highly complicated piece of technology, they also had a correct sense for what people want to use and had the social skills to champion their product within the company to gain support and the leadership skills to scale their product to a sizeable audience.

There's no doubt in this person's competence. All that remains for a company really is to convince them to join THIS company instead of the million other places and things they can do. 

Why is this extreme example so successful? Because everyone knows Gmail and understands the product well enough to realize it's really difficult to pull off, and especially difficult for a tiny team to pull it off well.

OK, let's now modify this pitch to:

"Created the first prototype of Pico (made up name, but let's assume it's a social network for teens), successfully launched it internally, and eventually led the team to scaling the product to 1 million users."

And let's say the company this candidate applies to doesn't know what Pico is, because it's only used by 1 millions teens in, say, Bangladesh.

This pitch becomes far less impressive, off the bat, than the first one because there is far greater uncertainty regarding what the product actually is. (TODO: expand on why).

There is now uncertainty over what 1 million users actually means. In the case of Gmail, since we know what it is, and have used it, and have seen our peers use it, we have no uncertainty over what users means because we've used it. But when someone just says "1 million users", does that mean they just downloaded the app? Does that mean these "users" just visited the product landing page only for most of them to leave? Or does this mean that these users are actually using the app on a regular basis? How regular of a basis? 

But this is still incredibly impressive because getting 1 million users for any product is a massive achievement. It still requires a great deal of competency in understanding what people want, creating it, giving it to them and maintaining the service to support their use.

There are 2 real tests for any software product:
1. Did people use it? How many? How regularly?
2. What is the inherent difficulty of creating this product.

The first measure is FAR more impressive than the latter because it proves competency in the entire software engineering process. When you build a product that is used by others, you're forced to build competence in a variety of skills: engineering a system to actually handle users, fixing bugs, dealing with customer issues, measuring how users are using it to correctly prioritize where to spend engineering time, balancing building new features vs. fixing issues and fighting fires to keep the app up and running.

These are the real-world skills that are incredibly valuable to companies because it maps well to the problems that you're likely to face at any company. If a company has reached the point to be able to hire, it means that they likely have a product / service that people are using. Any experience in the product building lifecycle translates well to this environment.

On the other hand, simply creating a complicated product that doesn't have any users and simply linking to a Github repository of the code makes it really difficult to verify your competence. An engineer at the company you applied to will have to pore over your code, try to get it to run on their machine and understand what you did to even have a bare minimum understanding of what you created. 

Most companies aren't going to spend that time vetting your repos and projects. 

The golden rule of pitching yourself is: **Uncertainty creates doubt in the human mind. If you want to get interviews, you must minimize uncertainty and doubt in the minds of potential employers.**

Let's tweak that pitch again to:

"Helped create Pico (mobile app for teens), successfully launched it internally at (some big tech company), scaling the product to 1 million users.".

This pitch creates SO MUCH DOUBT. What the hell does "helped" mean? Did you fix one bug in the entire product and your stellar teammate was the one who actually architected, designed and built the entire thing? When your team scaled it to users, did you actually engage with users to understand what they need and improved your product with that understanding, or were you fetching your team Pizzas every day so they can do the impressive, difficult work?

The only way for someone at the company to evaluate this pitch is to have a long, long conversation with this candidate to really dig into their true contribution, and then they'd have to also grill them on the technical bits to verify whether this candidate actually did this or is making it up. And even after all of that, the company would need to put the candidate through a long technical interview process to actually verify their ability in case they were BSing earlier.

This is a tough pitch. So much uncertainty that requires companies to spend a great deal of time (and assume they won't) to validate your true competence.

(In later sections we'll cover how to minimize uncertainty in your sales assets: pitch, resume, application, etc.)

And now put yourself in the shoes of a recruiter that is not technical, and he reads "Helped create Pico (mobile app for teens), successfully launched it internally at (some big tech company), scaling the product to 1 million users". If he doens't recognize the name of the tech company / the product you built, you're done.

Nothing else matters.

This is why learning how to sell yourself is so critical. If you have the right skills, but aren't getting interviews, you must learn how to sell yourself to minimize the uncertainty (and thereby perceived risk) in your skills.

In the next few sections I'm going to show you how to tailor your sales material (pitch, resume, personal website, etc.) to minimize doubt over your true competence.
