Effective job hunting is sales. You're selling your ability to create value - to companies. The best strategy is to bypass the direct application process by convincing a hiring manager / engineer directly that you're worth interviewing.

The rest of the playbook will elaborate on the steps outline below:

A. **Find & qualify companies**.
Framework for how to find companies and prioritize them so that you spend your precious time on the ones where you're most likely to get interviews.

B. **Prepare**: 
Learn how to pitch a compelling story with your projects, resume, personal website that demonstrates your ability to create value.

C. **Outreach**:
Applying online and waiting to hear back from a company is the weakest way to apply to a company - especially if you don't "look good" on paper - because, as we discussed earlier, you'll be screened out by either the ATS or the recruiter before your application ends up in the hands of engineers.

You have to find a way to get to the hiring manager / engineer at the company that has influence over the hiring process for the open position you want to apply for.

The goal is to get an internal referral: someone at the company who vouches for your competence and influences the company to give you an interview.

There are two categories of approaches to getting this internal referral: 
1. **Warm**. A warm introduction is when someone you know introduces you to someone they know at the company you want an interview at, vouching for your abilities.
2. **Cold**. You have no existing relationship / path to getting introduced to the company and therefore have to build this relationship from scratch. We'll go over how to do this by cold emailing, direct messaging, networking in person.

D. **Close**: 
1. Follow-up. Most approaches won't pan out immediately. Systematically, persistently, respectfully following up is the key to nurturing relationships that will sooner or later convert to interviews.
2. Convert losses to wins. With the right attitude and approach, it's possible to turn rejections in to opportunities.

E. **Phone screen**
Typically a short phone conversation that may or may not be technical (i.e. revolves around solving an engineering problem). Used to weed out incompetent candidates before the full-round of interviews that follows.

If you're here, the company wants to see you succeed. They're on your side. Your efforts shift from trying to get noticed, to actually demonstrating your competence.

F. **Final round interviews**
Usually multiple hours of interviews either solving software engineering challenges, and / or building projects.

G: **Offer**
Congrats!

This playbook will help you get the interview. After that, check out resources for links to books / videos / essays that will help you crack the actual interview. That's outside the scope of this playbook.

All the best.
