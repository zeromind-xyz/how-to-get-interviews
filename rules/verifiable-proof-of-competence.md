"competence" = Your ability to help the company solve their customers' problems by building and shipping products.

"proof" = Past experiences / projects / work that demonstrates your competence.

"verifiable" = Ability for someone to make sure that your proof of competence is real and not too ambiguous to make sense of, or fake.

If you haven't worked at a reputed company (a company that the companies you're applying to knows about and has respect for), and haven't graduated from a prestigious institution (top tier computer science college), then you need some kind of verifiable proof of competence to gain interviews at companies.

From a company's perspective, there is absolutely no reason to give you an interview if you have nothing that tangibly demonstrates your competence.
