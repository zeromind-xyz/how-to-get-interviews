**Competence**  = Your ability to help the company create value by positively impacting their process.

**Proof** = Work that you've done that demonstrates your competence. This could be past work experiences, contributions to projects, apps / products you've built, etc.

**Verifiable** = Ability for someone to check that your proof of competence is accurate, and real - with minimal effort.

If you haven't worked at a reputed company (a company that the companies you're applying to knows about and has respect for), and haven't graduated from a prestigious institution (top tier computer science college), then you need some kind of verifiable proof of competence to gain interviews at companies. 

From a company's perspective, interviewing candidates is expensive. There is absolutely no reason to give you an interview if you have nothing that tangibly demonstrates your competence. Having **verifiable proof of competence** is a core ingredient of successful job hunting. If you can pitch yourself well, but have nothing worth pitching, then your pitching won't lead to results.

Proof of competence and verifiability are both important. They're like two wings of a bird, if one is weak, then you can't fly.

Let's understand verifiable proof of competence with some examples.

**"Part of team at Bacme that launched the Bacme Search API product that's currently handling 10k API requests / month"**

There's no strong proof in this pitch because it's not clear what your role in the team was: did they architect / design the API? Did they do the back-end work to actually run the correct systems to serve the API request? Or did they focus on writing the documentation for an API spec that was designed by someone else? How big was the team that launched this product? What were their responsibilities in the scope of their project?

This pitch is **weak** because it raises more questions than it answers. Their contribution to the project is vague, and it's not possible to verify what they've actually done without tremendous effort: conversations with the candidate, their colleagues, and managers.

In addition to the ambiguity in the proof of competence, people haven't heard of Bacme and don't know the quality of their hiring process, so they have no idea of the competence of the average engineer at Bacme.

**"Core contributor (18 commits - github.com/yourprofile) to open source React scrolling library: github.com/someproject (120 stars). Work ranging from new features, extending support to more platforms, refactoring and documentation."**

This is a much more powerful pitch because it clearly shows proof of competence: you've contributed to an actual project that's used by others, and is verifiable through stars on Github, and because someone can literally go and see this candidate's commit history.

### The minimum bar

I recommend having a software project that you've built / contributed to in a meaningful way, that is used by other people, before you start aggressively reaching out to companies.

The number of users doesn't have to be in the millions, or hundreds of thousands, or even thousands. Having dozens / hundreds of people that have used your work is more than enough. And that's a lot easier to tangibly obtain.

In addition to having a project like this, you'll need to present it well: by focusing on its most impressive aspect quickly, to hold the reader's attention.

- Treat it as an iterative process (alongside applying to companies). Bec. you don't know the market until you test it.
