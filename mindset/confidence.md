I think it's helpful to have some cognitive dissonance: allow yourself to be humbled by the greats on a regular basis and let your "feel" for the average climb. But when it's time to job hunt, turn that system off and have a more realistic gauge of your competence. If in doubt, bias towards greater confidence.
	* More tips to increase confidence that I've found to be super helpful:
		* I've found that relentless practice is a great way to boost confidence in anything: whether it's taking the game winning shot, giving a speech in front of a large audience, and interviewing at companies.
		* I have stage fright, but I know with enough practice there comes a point when I'll be able to go out there and deliver a speech with ease. 
		* Depending on your level of fear / lack of confidence, I suggest putting even more effort into the practice.
		* And you have to. Natalie Portman, Kobe Bryant, Steve Jobs all practiced for a stupid amount of time before their scenes / game-winning shots / world-class product presentations. They practiced so much that you & I felt like they were born to do this.
