# Introduction

The objective of this guide is to help you apply successfully to your first software engineering job at a Tech company in the United States.

We wrote this guide with the following audience background in mind: 

You:
-   may not have brand name companies on your resume, attended a top computer science program (or attended school at all).
-   haven’t had a software engineering job in the past.
-   have some kind of programming training: you are familiar with some language & framework and are able to build working applications. Maybe you are in your final year of a computer science program or you just graduated a programming bootcamp.
-   understand computer science fundamentals well, and are comfortable solving typical interview-style problems. Check out our interview prep guide in case you’re not sure: <link to our interview prep guide>.
-   already have a sense of companies you’d be interested in working in, or you don’t care much and you just want to get started working. While choosing which company to work at is an important topic, we felt it’d be too much to fit into this guide, so stay tuned for that guide in the coming weeks!

That being said, many of these application strategies should apply to people that don’t necessary fit our target audience mold: for example, even if you’ve had a software engineering career for a while and are looking to make a move, etc.

There is no standard application & interview process that companies use. The style, duration, steps involved in an interview process varies greatly based on factors like: company size, industry, company leadership backgrounds, location, culture, biases, etc. Companies also vary greatly on how they evaluate candidates for what may seem like a similar job description.

This also means that getting rejected at one company doesn’t say much about your odds of rejection at the next. 

When applying to companies, it helps to think of this process as a sales process: **you are the product that you are selling to companies - to help them solve a problems they have, to help them achieve their goals.**

In order to understand how to sell your services to a company, we need to first understand how a company thinks: what it wants when hiring someone, how it evaluates candidates at each step of the process, and how it makes hiring decisions.

# How Companies Evaluate You

A company wants to hire you for $x in the hopes that you will create **much greater than $x worth of impact.** 

  

Gauging your impact potential is not easy. 

  

People within a company have different beliefs on the qualities of good candidates, have different ways to evaluate those candidates and have a different set of personal goals that they’re optimizing for - based on how they’re incentivized. **Hiring decision-making at companies is not straightforward and can seem irrational at times.**

  

A company’s interview process aims to approximate your impact potential through a series of assessments and interviews. You may be the best engineer on the planet, and may be able to deliver tremendous value to a company if hired, but **if you don’t meet a company’s expectations for what a candidate with great potential looks like, you will likely not get an offer.**

## **Application and interview process**

There are no standard application and interview processes. But many companies, especially larger tech companies (think Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.). use the following, or slightly modified version of the following, process. [2]

  

![](https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_54829BBC8590352CB9932441CFF6C3D2617D7393028E93AF6181174FD4C50FE3_1556666416705_application-flow0.5x.png)

**Job Posting Created**

Someone in the company wants to hire someone onto their team. They recognize a need, draft up a job description, go through the necessary hoops to get it approved, then share with the talent/recruiting team for them to post the listing and manage applicants.

  

This person is referred to as the **hiring manager**. For software engineer positions hiring manager is usually an engineer or engineering manager. Recruiters work with hiring managers to refine the job description and align on the qualities of the ideal candidate for that role.

  

**Enter the system**

The first step is to make the company aware that you exist and are interested in job there. There are many ways to do this, outlined in the <link to Applying Channels section>. 

  

Before you enter the system, or once you enter the system, you will typically engage with a company recruiter.

  

A **recruiter** is company employee who is incentivized to fill open positions at the company, with as few resources as possible, as quickly as possible. Generally, a company recruiter is compensated with a base salary, and then a bonus for each position they can fill, along with another bonus if they can fill x number of roles in a certain time period, such as within a quarter.

  

In order for a recruiter to maximize the number of positions they fill, they want to find candidates that will:

1.  pass the onsite interview if put through one.
2.  will accept an offer if presented with one, within the maximum budget for that position.

  

In this first step, the recruiter will attempt qualify you as much as they with minimal involvement from the engineering team, before passing you onto further stages of the interview process that the engineering team handles. 

  

Interviewing is expensive for companies. If a single candidate goes through the entire interview process, it could cost a company thousands of dollars: all of the engineer’s and recruiters time spent on interviewing instead of building product, plus the lack of additional resources to speed up product development that could have resulted in greater revenue, and the cost of attention context switching - which can be especially a big time sink for engineers.

  

Let’s say a recruiter has 100 applications, and the engineering team can only interview onsite 15 candidates a month. The recruiter wants to chose the top 15 candidates in the 100 that applied, that best meet criteria 1 and 2 above.

  

**Most recruiters you’ll meet don’t have a technical background.** Therefore, when looking at your application/resume, they’ll rely on proxy signals, such as:

-   **Brand name companies:** If you’ve already interned at companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft etc, then a recruiter is likely to move you onto the next round, as long as you seem “gettable”, i.e. you show that you are interested and excited about the recruiter’s company. Passing these other companies’ interview process correlates with your ability to pass this company’s interview process, since they’re likely similar.
-   **Top academic school:** You are going / went to a top computer science program. Many recruiters and companies believe that students from top computer science academic programs have a strong potential to be effective engineers.

  

Even if you have the necessary company and academic brands on your resume, recruiters may also try to gauge if your technical experience is a fit for the job description. For example, if a company really needs a React.js developer to join the team and hit the ground running, they won’t want a candidate that’s only worked in C. This filtering is less likely to happen for software engineering roles at larger companies, since these companies have the resources to train you for these positions, and therefore are looking for fundamental competence that can be molded in any direction. Smaller companies and startups usually don’t have this luxury.

  

Companies with a lot of inbound applications also employ automated resume screening systems. These systems will look to automate the resume scanning that recruiters do.

  

Don’t worry if you don’t have these proxy signals such as a Google or Facebook internship experience or if you don’t go to a reputed computer science program - a small percentage of programmers actually do. We’ll go through strategies to circumvent these proxy-signal based screenings in the **how to apply to companies** section below.

  

3.  **Automated technical screen**

It’s becoming more common for companies to use automated technical screening assignments as part of the initial screening - before passing you onto interviews with engineers.

  

This is a low cost way for the recruiter to gauge your technical ability that correlates with your chances to pass the onsite interview.

  

Some companies and recruiters give everyone that applies an automated technical assignment, because they’re cheap to administer: it requires little to no time from the company’s side, and they pay very little for each test taken. At other companies, a recruiter may only give you an automated technical challenge if your application seems like it has potential.

  

[Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [Codility](https://www.codility.com/), [Qualified](https://www.qualified.io/) are some common platforms that companies use to send you automated technical assignments. <Read our interview prep guide to learn how to best prepare for these>.

  

4.  **Recruiter screen**

The recruiter sees enough potential in your application to move you to the next phase. They will likely schedule a call with you to discuss the engineering phone screen that you’ll have.

  

At this stage, the recruiter also wants to know if you would accept an offer if you received one - within a budget range the recruiter can work with. You may get a question about your expected salary. **Don’t answer this question with an exact number** since you lose your ability to negotiate your salary later on - if and when you get an offer. A simple, yet effective answer is: “I’m expecting a competitive market level salary”. This is a way to answer the question that allows you to discuss salary specifics when you should be: **after** you get the offer. 

  

The recruiter is also gauging how excited you are about the role and company. Regardless of how good you are, if you don’t seem interested, recruiters are less likely to invest further in you since you don’t seem like you’d take an offer if presented one.

  

5.  **Engineer technical phone screen**

You’ve passed the recruiter’s initial screen and are passed on to the engineering team - which is likely the team that you will work on, if you join the company.

  

The **engineer** wants to help hire someone that will help them solve the problems that their team is facing. Remember, this person will be working alongside you for the foreseeable future. Not only do they want to bring onto the team someone that can get the job done, but also someone that they can envision working well with day in and day out.

  

The following are some qualities we hear often, when we ask engineers and engineering managers to describe their ideal teammate.

-   **Enthusiastic, Passionate**
-   **Works well with others**
-   **Coachable:** You take constructive feedback well, without getting defensive. You put the team’s objective over your own, when making decisions.
-   **Strong communicator:** You can clearly communicate problems, concepts to allow others to get on your page quickly.
-   **Curious:** You ask why and dig into problems and solutions to understand them deeply.
-   **Quick learner:** You have a strong foundational understanding that enables you to quickly pick up new languages, technologies, libaries and apply them to problems that your team is facing.
-   **Empathetic**
-   **Self-aware:** You understand your strengths and weakness and can work with your teammates to help you improve / bridge your weaknesses.
-   **Honest**: you’re transparent about when something isn’t working, or when you’re not doing something the right way. You understand when to seek help when you’re stuck on a problem. 
-   **Strong product sense:** 

-   You understand who is using the product / service that your team is producing. 
-   You understand why they’re using it. 
-   You can use this understanding to shape your prioritization and decision-making on the team. 
-   You argue for a product direction based on what your users want, rather than what you want or think would be cool. 
-   You understand how 

-   **Clear thinker**
-   **Effectively reasons about trade-offs: product, technical, organizational**
-   **Delivers code that actually works**
-   **Effectively reasons about edge cases:** you know the boundary conditions of your product / code. You know where the bugs are likely to arise from in which scenarios. This ability can drastically improve product support.
-   **Thinks long-term:** You can reason about what the right next steps are for the product, and why - this goes hand in hand with product sense: knowing your team’s audience helps you prioritize what to do next.

  

**Note:** Each person / team / organization prioritizes desired qualities differently. 

  

When you’re interviewing, you have an opportunity to demonstrate these qualities.

  

A technical phone screen is generally broken up into the following parts:

-   Introductions and chat about past experience (10 mins)
-   Technical problems (40 - 45 mins)
-   Q/A for candidate to ask interviewer any questions about the role, company, etc. (5 - 10 mins)

  

6.  **Onsite** **Interview** 

After you pass the technical phone screen, the company will schedule an onsite interview.

Usually during onsite interviews you’ll spend a day at the company getting grilled with technical and behavioral interviews.

  

A typical schedule: 

-   10am - 11am: interview 1 (with engineer)
-   11am - 12pm: interview 2 (with engineer)
-   noon - 1: lunch “interview” (with the team)
-   1 - 2pm: interview 3 (with engineer / data scientist)
-   2pm - 3pm: interview 4 (with engineer)
-   3pm - 4pm: interview 5 / chat (with engineering manager, hiring manager)
-   4pm: closing with recruiter. With maybe a tour of the campus, etc.

  

7.  **Offer and negotiation**

The interview process is long, involves multiple people and spans weeks. It’s expensive to interview a candidate. On top of this, say if a company interviews 10 candidates, extends an offer to 5, to have 1 accept, they’ve spent the cost to interview 10 candidates in order to make a single hire. **That’s expensive!!!** It also means that a company is highly incentivized to get you to accept an offer. Use that to your advantage and negotiate. [x]

  

TODO: Here are guides that others have written that we strongly recommend to better understand how to negotiate well:

  

**Decision-making**

Once you are handed off to the engineering team for the engineer phone screen, the recruiter has little power to reject you [x]. After this point the recruiter’s incentives aren’t necessarily aligned with the team’s: the recruiter wants an offer to be handed to the candidate that they’ll accept, while the team may want to hold off for a better candidate.

  

Similarly a team’s incentives may not be aligned with the company’s. Let’s say a team is significantly understaffed. They may want to extend an offer to an applicant that is good enough but not great, in order to ease their immediate pain. 

  

To counter-act this natural prioritization for the short-term over long-term, companies companies have introduced a **bar-raiser** into the final decision making process. The bar-raiser is an engineer / engineering manager from a different team at the company, that doesn’t feel the short-term burn of this team and therefore is better poised to see whether the applicant would improve the engineering bar at the company in the long-run or not. This bar-raiser can veto a hiring decision made by the team. 

  

The recruiter usually has no say in the final decision made by the team. They are brought back into the picture if an offer is extended, and it becomes the recruiter’s job to convince you to take the offer and negotiate terms.

  

**Optimization**

It helps to think of this application process as a funnel that you can optimize. From one step to another, you’ll likely have a drop-off rate. 

  

For example, let’s say: 

-   you submit applications to 100 companies, 
-   hear back positively from 90 companies.
-   get a phone screen from 80.
-   get called for onsite interviews from 5.

  

This means that you have only a  10% drop-off from application to hearing back step, but you have a 93.75% drop-off from your phone screen to onsite interview stage. Which means you should really focus on how to improve your phone screens.

  

Viewing your process as a funnel helps you prioritize the areas to improve in your application process. In the above example, it’s clear that you should spend time practicing the phone screen so that you convert more of them into onsite interviews. 

  

It’s important to make sure that decreasing drop-off at one stage doesn’t result in increased drop-off later on. For example, if you dump a bunch of keywords into your resume to make it more likely to pass the automated resume screening, but it causes human readers to be confused, it won’t have a net positive effect on your application process.

  

**Bias & Randomness**

A bad hire is tremendously expensive for companies of all sizes and shapes. At larger companies that invest in training and molding hires for longer periods: such as 6 months, a bad hire could mean that not only did you waste a bunch of time to hire someone, you’ve also wasted MONTHS of your team’s time to train and ramp this person up, only to fire later. That is hundreds of thousands of dollars of lost value creation. At startups, a bad hire can suck a lot of the team’s time to produce nothing… which could cause the company to die.

  

Therefore, companies pattern match by hiring people that they think _should_ do fine, based on whatever personal biases they have for what they think _should_ correlate with strong on-job performance. This is a rational bias that stems from the high cost of a bad hire.

  

Ideally, every company can give candidates a multi-week trial period and see how they’d fare. After all there’s no better signal for how a candidate will work on the job, than to have them work on the job for a period of time… but this isn’t feasible for both companies and the best candidates [x].

  

Don’t take it to heart if a company passed on interviewing you because you don’t look on paper, the way they think you should look in order to be effective at their company. We’ll help you bridge the gap in you application, but some companies are bound to pass up on you regardless. [It happens to the best of us.](https://rejected.us/)

# Selling

**Selling your abilities well maximizes job opportunities.**

  

Selling can’t compensate for a bad product: in other words, if you don’t have the technical competence to get a job, not matter how well you sell yourself, you will fail at later parts of the interview process. [x] The same goes the other way around: if you’re really technically and behaviorally competent, but can’t communicate that competence in a way the company understands/expects, your opportunities will be limited.

  

We’ve seen many applicants feel that their desire to join a company outsizes the company’s desire to hire someone for a role. This is incorrect. Companies, especially quickly growing companies, are often desperate to fill their open positions as quickly as possible.

  

When you’re interviewed, or when someone is looking at your resume, they are trying to find a reason to say YES and move you forward. This means you should focus on your strengths and put your best, most impressive work up front and center. 

# Selling: Resume

Your resume is an essential selling material. Every person that has an influence on your hiring will use your resume at some point during the process.

  

The primary audiences for your resume are:

-   recruiters
-   engineers
-   hiring managers

  

**Recruiters look at your resume to:**

-   see how good of a match you are for the open position that you applied to - by looking at which technologies you’ve used and matching it to what the job description has… recruiters at larger companies might not care as much about the exact technologies, but that you have a solid enough background that can be molded through training. [x]
-   gauge your ability to pass the onsite interview by pattern matching: if people from your college / previous company were able to get jobs at this company, then the recruiter will feel you could also have the technical competence to pass, since you have a similar background.
-   gauge the depth of your past experiences: for example, if you’ve led a team in the past to accomplish a note-worthy business outcome, then the recruiter will feel that you’re more likely to have the competence for this role. It also helps them gauge how much of a salary range you could demand, given your experience.

  

Expect recruiters to **not spend more than 30 seconds** on your resume. You want to make it stupidly easy to consume the best parts about you at a quick glance.

  

**Engineers and hiring managers use your resume to:**

-   see if you have the experience that they feel their team needs
-   know what is fair to ask you during the interviews 
-   think about questions to ask: technical and behavioral, to start a discussion about your past work.

## **What to Include**

[https://www.dropbox.com/s/64biibf6i3iqon3/me.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/64biibf6i3iqon3/me.pdf?dl=0)  

**Contact information**

People need to be able to reach out to you. You may or may not want to include phone number, but you should include an **email address**.

  

**Relevant work experience**

Prior work is one of the most powerful signals to both recruiters and future teammates. If you’ve worked with any organization in the past in a technical capacity that you feel would translate to performing well in a software engineering role, include it.

  

Guidelines for how to write experience bullet points:

-   Use action-oriented language. 
-   Be very specific about your role in launching the product / feature / output.
-   Measure the work: 

-   How many users? 
-   Performance and scalability.
-     
    

-   Include links to blogposts or any kind of coverage for the product you worked on.
-   Link to any working demo of you work.

  

For example, if you built an API that is used by another team at your company to enable end-users to search company support content:

-   Worked in team of 5 to build a search API that enables searching company support content that enables search functionality for 10 million customers across 5 continents
-   Played part in design, architecture and partial development of API.
-   Handles 1m concurrent API calls with **0.6 second response time** at for **99 percentile average.**

  

Include links to any published papers, or company blogposts that describe the work you did.

  

**Projects**

What have you built in the past? Do you have anything that demonstrates your ability to build working, living products that can be used by people?

  

Use the same guidelines for experiences for your project. In addition, we highly recommend having a demo link as well as a write-up for your project. If your project is usable, it really helps to share a link that allows a reader to actually use what you’ve built - there’s more powerful way to communicate what you built than to let someone play around with it.

  

If you feel like your projects are more impressive than your past work experiences, you could combine these into a single section titled something along the lines of: “projects and work”, and order them by how impressive they were. You don’t need to order them chronologically if you feel that your most impressive, best work was further in the past than your most recent experience. Remember, you’re trying to give readers a chance to say YES to moving you forward.

  

We also recommend having a short write-up for your project - perhaps in the form of a blogpost, or somewhere on your website, that explains the purpose behind this project, what problem does it aim to solve, who uses it, why do they use it? 

  

Story-telling is an effective way to communicate any work that you’ve done. Learn more about how to communicate a project in the next section.

  

**Objective**

What job are you looking for. It’s debatable how useful this line is, since the position you want can be inferred from what you applied to, but it could be useful when your resume is circulated without context for what job you applied to (let’s say for example, someone stumbles upon it through your website), or say if you drop it off at a company booth during a career fair where people are looking for both internships and full-time offers.

  

Unless you absolutely know what kind of work you want to do, we recommend keeping it a bit open ended. In other words, rather than saying that you’re interested in pursuing front-end positions that require React.js, you could say that you’re interested in a software engineering role, focusing on building great user experiences.

  

**Education**

If you went to / are going to college, include your college, major, concentration (if your major was technical and relates to the job you’ve applied to). Your gpa isn’t necessary, but doesn’t hurt to include it if it’s greater than a 3.0. 

  

**Research and Teaching**

Have you been a teaching assistant for any of your classes? Have you done any research? Teaching signals strong communication skills and a thorough understanding of the subject you taught. 

  

Research, unless you actually produced something valuable, is often used to gauge your communication ability: how well can you distill complex theoretical concepts in a way that anyone can understand them? If the position you apply to is in a research context - for example, an engineering position in an autonomous vehicle company, then your research background may play a bigger role.

  

**Coursework / Training**

How did you learn about computer science and programming? Have you completed any coursework - whether at an institution, online or self-study? It can help to list out the training that you’ve had in order to communicate the breadth of your computer science understanding.

  

**Leadership**

Have you done anything that communicates your ability to lead / work well with others to deliver tangible results? Doesn’t have to be a Tech related endeavor. 

  

**Skills**

Languages, frameworks, libraries that you’re comfortable using - relevant to software engineering. It helps to include qualifiers such as: 

-   proficient
-   working understanding

to help readers understand how well you know this skill. 

  

**Work authorization**

If you have a foreign sounding name, but are American / a permanent resident / are authorized to work in the United States, you should mention this. Unfortunately, we’ve heard about and seen a reduction in resume rejections when candidates make it clear that they’re already authorized to work in the states. 

  

This is because many companies don’t want to go through the hassle of filing for an H1B for their employees, and will pass up interviewing you if you there’s a chance they’ll have to. 

(Let us know if you’d like to see a comprehensive guide on how to best navigate the H1B process as a computer science undergrad / grad student).

  

**Guidelines**

-   **length:** keep your resume to one page. You will be able to fit everything into one page, we promise.
-   **layout:** Doesn’t really matter if you choose to go with multiple columns or a single column, but do put your best work up front and center. When someone barely spends 20 seconds glancing at your resume, you want to make it dead-easy to take away they best parts of your experiences.
-   **details:** Make sure fonts, font colors, spacing are consistent. Lack of consistency in a product that is consumed by people that make their livings on attention to detail could create a negative impression... Why take the chance? Spend the extra minutes polishing.
-   **Grammar and spelling:** If you’re not proficient in English, ask your English speaking friends for feedback on your resume language. (or reach out to us and we’ll provide quick feedback for you). Unfortunately spelling and grammar mistakes could create a negative impression in readers’ minds - whether conscious or subconscious. At the least, it shows that you didn’t take the time to polish your resume - which is the first impression companies have of you.
-   **Lying on your resume:** Yeah, this is dumb - from the perspective of landing a good job (short-term) AND building a great career (long-term).

# Selling: Communicating

  

**Every interaction is an opportunity to communicate what you can bring to the table.**

  

A powerful way to communicate how you can deliver value is to discuss what you’ve actually done in the past that demonstrates competence relevant to the position you’ve applied to and/or what the company is doing. 

  

By effectively communicating your past work experience / project, you have the opportunity to demonstrate:

  

**Clarity of thought** 

Effective communication is a highly valued skill. Many frustrations and time wastage at companies stem from communication gaps between different teams and stakeholders.

  

When you explain your past project, you want to help people **visualize** what you’ve done. This helps them better evaluate the usefulness, complexity, and see how clearly you can communicate what you’ve done.

  

Avoid filler words that you think makes your project sound cool, but doesn’t actually communicate anything. For example: 

  

“**Xnote is an app that transformed the way students took and shared notes”**

What does transformed mean? How exactly is this different from taking notes on Google docs? Why would anyone use this? At this point, I have absolutely no idea what your project actually enables.

  

**“Xnote is an Android app that lets people save web articles, annotate an them by highlighting and typing a note, and easily share it with friends.**

I know what the app does. Even if it doesn’t sound cool, or amazing, or even complicated, I can visualize what it would feel like to use this app in my mind. Since I can visualize it, I’m likely to have a lot more questions about it. You want to engage your listener and present you work in a way that is interesting and lures them into asking more about it to dig deeper. This gives you an opportunity to share more aspects of your work, thereby a greater opportunity to demonstrate your competence. 

  

**Product sense** 

Can you reason about who would use your project, why they would want it, and how your audience’s needs impact how you prioritize development and make decisions?

  

Software isn’t built in a vacuum - it needs to positively impact somebody: whether that’s your company’s customers or other teams / teammates. Understanding who will benefit from your work, and how your work fits into the grander picture of what the company is trying to accomplish helps you and your team prioritize work and make the right decisions. 

  

**Reasoning about trade-offs**

Every project requires making trade-offs: whether consciously or unconsciously. Trade-offs arise due to constraints such as having limited time to build something, or that your audience has older generation phones that you need to support, meaning everything has to be more optimized, or your audience is very price sensitive and doesn’t want to consume data, meaning you need to think hard about how to minimize data consumption in your app.

  

You project may have a different set of constraints, but it’s valuable to be able to understand what your constraints were, and reason about what actions you took in the context of these constraints.

  

**Can you deliver?**

Can you actually deliver software that can be used? Does your project work? Have people used it? Do you use it? There’s a **world of a difference** between something that doesn’t work and something that can be used. If you built something that can actually be used, you should highlight this in your conversations.

  

**Edge-case reasoning:**

Do you know where your product will fail? What its limitations are? There are bound to be cases that will break your solution. Maybe it breaks when people with certain operating system versions try to use it, or when people with certain browsers try to access it. Or if more than n number of people try to access it at once. It’s good to know or be able to hypothesize about what could break your product. It shows that you have the ability to be pro-active and work to fix issues before they occur, rather than be reactive and just handle problems as they come in. Pro-activity is a big asset for any team.

  

**Ability to think longer-term**

Your project does one thing now. What about in the future? This ties in with product sense: if you know the audience for your project, and what their needs are, you should be able to think about what additional features would make this even more valuable… 

  

**Technical rigor**

Can you talk about each language / library / tool you used to build your project? Maybe not at the depth of how the library works, but at least that parts it that you needed to understand in order to build your project. For example, if you used React.js to build something, can you talk about how React manages state, and how data flows through the application? 

  

**Passion**

Do you like what you do?

  

**Learning ability**

What are the tools that you had to learn to build what you did. Can you explain the journey you took to learning them? 

  

**General** **positive traits**

Completing and launching a project, however small, demonstrates the ability to get things done, to persevere, to have the courage to put something out for the world to see and judge you on - challenging things to do, no matter how small the project. 

  

As discussed earlier, these are qualities that engineers look for when gauging your competence.

## **Example project explanation**

Now, we’ll take a sample project that we’ll discuss in the context of an engineer picking a candidate’s brain about it. (note: the project is from 2015, so some of the technical details may no longer be relevant).

  

**Sally** **(engineer):** **Hey Bob, could you tell me about a project that you’ve built in the past?** **(you** **could also initiate this conversation).**

  

**Bob:** Sure thing. One of my favorite projects was Xnote that a friend and worked on over a summer last year. It’s an Android app that lets people save web articles to their phone to read later, annotate them by highlighting regions and typing an note, and easily share an annotated article with their friends.

  

In the end we launched to all of our friends, and had about 200 installs, and about 10 people actively using it.

  

Our motivation was that: we’d read and share a lot of articles between ourselves and our friends, but we caught ourselves doing a lot of “Hey check out the 3rd paragraph in this article, isn’t it cool how…”. Basically we wanted to be able to embed our thoughts into specific areas of articles that we shared, but couldn’t find a good tool to do it with.

  

**Sally: Aah nice! I actually use Instapaper and I think they have that feature.** 

  

**B:** Yeah, we really like Instapaper. It’s a solid app. They actually released their annotation feature while we were working on ours. But theirs is only for iOS, not Android.

  

**S: Cool. How did you build it?**

  

**B:** We built the app in Android, we initially wanted to use React Native, but realized soon that it didn’t support the text highlighting features well enough for us to move forward with it. 

  

We had a **time constraint** and wanted to launch a working product as soon as we could. So we tried to find services that would do some of the heavy lifting for us. For the article parsing, we used an API from a company called Diffbot - where we specify the url, and it would download just the article text and not the other junk like ads, and article recommendations. 

  

And we also used Parse for the backend. It’s a database as a service that let us push data to the Parse cloud so we didn’t have to spin up and manage our own database. This helped us get it off the ground quickly, but we had a LOT of trouble making getting Parse to work without crashing and throwing random issues, so we eventually migrated over to MongoDB and hosted it on mlab.

  

**S: Interesting. What didn’t work well with Parse?**

  

**B:** Firstly, the community wasn’t that strong, so if we had any questions that other developers didn’t have, we were left in the dark. The support team at Parse were slow to get back to us - understandable given we were using the free tier. We also ended up writing non-performant hacks to get around some of the issues we were facing, which caused significant delays in fetching and posting data. Since people using our app were used to other high performant apps like Pocket, or any popular consumer app for that matter, they weren’t that happy with the 5 second long loading spinner every time they tried to save or load a note.

  

Our code became such a mess that eventually even working with it became a dread and time-consuming. We decided to move over to MongoDB to take advantage of the huge community around it and to have more granular control of our queries and optimizations.

  

We also considered Firebase (another database as a service), but didn’t want to have another Parse like experience, though looking back, the community seems quite strong, and I think we would have been fine if we chose Firebase. 

  

All in all, **we wasted at least a sprint** to make the transition over to MongoDB. We learned that spending a couple of extra days choosing the right technology can save a lot of time down the road.

  

**S: Aah yes. That happens more often than I'd like to admit - especially when using a hot, new technology. We try our best to stay current with what’s out there - so that we can leverage better features, etc., but sometimes it just makes more sense to use what we know works and what we have experience with.** 

  

**B:** True that. What were some times when you regretted using a library?

  

**S:** We recently had a project where we used React Native so that we could develop for iOS and Android together, with one team… but a week into the process of migrating, we realized that we had too many modules that needed to directly use platform dependent modules, so we decided to stop migrating to React Native.  **So, what were some other challenges you faced while building this app?**

  

**B:** That’s interesting… (and maybe you could ask a follow up question on React Native / their experience with it).

  

For us, **Android fragmentation** was a huge pain. We wanted to target 5.0 Lollipop alone, but many of our friends were on earlier versions, so we decided to target both 4.0 and 5.0. That itself wasn’t too bad, but certain visual elements appeared differently, and sometimes didn’t even appear, on certain devices. For example, our plus button at the bottom right of the screen, to take a new note, wouldn’t even appear on OnePlus devices initially. We realized that we had to handle that device separately in our code.

  

In general, **testing across various devices and OSes** was a lot more work than we’d anticipated. Looking back, we should have either: a) shelled out some money to buy a testing service that would run our apps on a variety of devices and OS versions, or simply not support lower OS versions have a disclaimer explaining devices we were having issues with. We should have just picked a smaller audience and ran with it, and dealt with these weird cases after we already had some traction and people were using it.

  

Another challenge was that our article parser wasn’t able to handle certain websites. In fact, after about a month of using the API, about 20% of the articles we tried to download would fail with the service we were using. This was a horrible user experience that I think alone pushed people away from using our app. Especially when other apps like Pocket / Instapaper were pretty good about being able to parse web articles correctly.

  

A feature of our app was that, if you shared your annotated article with a friend, and they didn’t have Xnote downloaded, they could still see your annotated article as a web article. For this, we had our own web server that would render the article and the annotations. This was super tricky because in Android, we used a TextView to render the text and we used Text Spans to render the highlights on the text. On the web, we used a library called **rangy** to render highlights using xpaths to determine where to render the highlight on the html. Sometimes translating TextView highlights to html highlights through rangy wasn’t consistent - causing the highlights to show up a few characters, and sometimes a few words, off. We realized that we just had to handle a bunch of cases separately - leading to a glob of code, but a solution that finally produced the translation from Android to Web as we wanted.

  

We also had to learn to program Android in order to get this off the ground.

  

**S: If you could build it again, what would you have done differently?**

-   As mentioned before, we should have restricted the Android audience or have started with iOS - since it’s easier to build and deploy an iOS app that works across devices.
-   We would have thought harder about whether to use Parse or not, and would have chosen either Firebase or Mongo from the start.

  

**S: How would you take this project forward if you had the time?**

From an end-user’s perspective:

-   Launch a **web version**. It’s too constraining to restrict people to only annotate on their phones. Our audience consumed information on both their phone and laptop, therefore enabling our solution to work seamlessly across mobile and desktop would be useful.

  

**S: What were your biggest learnings from working on this?**

-   Good products take time to develop and get to the level of polish they should be at in order to be useful. I definitely underestimated this going into this project. We should have given ourselves 6 more months to continue working on it. We naively thought that in 3 months we could have a fully fleshed out, working product AND have a bunch of people using it.
-   We found it helpful to divide work by features, rather than front-end and back-end, because it gave us the joy of building and launching an entire feature by working through the entire stack. Of course, in other situations I would lean toward dividing by strength, but in this case, both us didn’t really know much, so it was also an opportunity for us to learn the entire stack of mobile development.

## **Summary**

The point of this exercise was to demonstrate that you should be thinking about your projects from many, many angles that allow you to demonstrate your competence.

  

You don’t have to have actually built a full-fledged app for you to be able to communicate your project well. It’s helpful to demonstrate that you can think from many angles, and articulate what you would have done - even if you didn’t already do it.

  

This applies also to your past experiences: you should prepare to be able to analyze them from multiple angles and showcase qualities that are valuable.

  

If you have a project that you’re struggling to articulate well, feel free to reach out to us!

We’ll work with you to help you develop your project and experience stories.

# Selling: Online Presence

**Personal website**

Your personal website can be a great tool to communicate what you’ve done, what you’re looking to do and who you are to future employers, teammates, companies, whoever. Its purpose sounds similar to your resume, but you have a lot more space to communicate on your website.

  

Re-iterating the same message as your resume. In fact, talk about how re-iterating a message is a powerful way to get it across.

  

You could show **live demos**, **screenshots of past projects, longer blogposts** about why you worked on something. 

  

While you may have many audiences for your website, for the sake of getting a job, you should make it easy for recruiters and engineers to understand 

  

-   Projects up front and center.
-   Working demos.
-   Write-ups / blogposts about past work.

# Applying

OK. You know what companies are looking for, how they evaluate candidates, and how to prepare your selling material. Let’s see how to actually apply to companies now.

  

There’s a trade-off for each of the following approaches. Experiment with the ways and see what clicks for you.

## **Personal network**

**The most effective way to apply to a company is through someone you know there.** 

  

1. **Direct referral:** If you know this person well, and they can vouch for your ability, you could directly ask them to [refer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recruitment#Employee_referral) you to a position at the company. When you’re referred, you typically by-pass the initial automated recruiter screening and head straight into a conversation with a recruiter. Many times you’ll be fast-tracked to a phone screen with an engineer, though sometimes you may still have to have an automated technical screen. This is a **highly effective way** to apply to a company. They can’t ignore you if someone at the company has vouched for you. 

  

Depending on how well you know this person at a company, it might make you uneasy to directly ask for a referral. In that case, you could work with the following template to communicate your desire for a job there: 

  

“Hey ___, I’d appreciate a chance to chat with you about what it’s like to work at AcmeCorp, and to see if I could be a good fit for one of the open opportunities in (software engineering/front-end engineering/back-end engineering/<insert role>“.

  

After you chat with them, you could then directly ask for the referral: “would you be able to refer me to this position”?

  

2. **Asking for Introductions:**

If your connection at a company can’t refer you or works in a different department (say Sales), you should ask them to introduce you to someone in the software engineering department: such as an engineer, lead engineer or engineering manager. 

  

Points to remember about asking for introductions:

-   **Make it easy for people to help you.** Treat your communication as a product that they are the user for, and optimize that user experience. People will notice that you respect their time, and will be more likely to help you now and in the future.
-   **Be specific about your asks.** It’s more work for someone to act on “Hey, could you intro me to someone you know in engineering”, vs. actually providing a list of people that you’d be interested to chat with.
-   **Put yourself in the recipient's shoes:** While you may feel that you’d definitely be OK taking up a coffee invitation with anyone that wants to pick your brain about anything, understand how busy professionals typically are. When your calendar is slammed for 2 weeks, and you have a deadline coming up to deliver a project, you’re going to think many times before committing to a meeting.

  

Do your research about the company, before you reach out. Compile a list of names that you’d like to reach out to - ranked in order of how interested you are in speaking with them, based on how aligned their work and background is with what you want to do. This way, when you ask your contact for an introduction, they can simply scan the list you sent and see if they know those people. If they don’t know anyone on the list, then they can introduce you to whoever they know in that department. If they don’t know anyone in that department (maybe because they’re new to the company), then you still have options:

  

a) Ask your contact if there are any **events** coming up that may have engineering representation, that you can attend. Unless this company is a super small start-up struggling to survive, they will likely invest in hosting / sponsoring events. Going to a company wide event will give you the opportunity to meet people from engineering that you can chat with. (See the “Events” section below for tips on how to introduce yourself to someone at an event).

  

b) Choose a couple of people from the list that you created above, and ask your contact if they’d be comfortable introducing you to them. You should create an email that could be easily forwarded to the person of interest to see if they’d be interested in chatting. 

  

**Email introduction request example:**

---

Hey <my_contact>, I’d greatly appreciate an introduction to <person_of_interest>. You can simply forward this email to them to see if they’re interested and then CC me if they are.

  

Hi <person_of_interest>, 

I saw your recent post <link_to_post> about how your team used and scaled a React Native solution. I recently used React Native for a personal project and your tips helped - especially about how to break up state management for large applications, so thanks! 

  

I’m looking for a full-stack software engineering position and was hoping to grab a quick coffee with you to ask for advice on how I can structure my software engineering career, learn about engineering at AcmeCorp, and to share more about my experiences and see if there could be a fit on your team for someone with my background

  

Would Friday at noon work for you at <coffee shop RIGHT next to their office> <or ask for phone call>? If not, I’m happy to work around your schedule, so feel free to propose any other time.

  

Thanks in advance.

  

Regards,

  

<you>

**Let’s break this introduction email down:**

-   First of all, you make it super easy for your contact to forward this. Assume everyone is stupidly busy - every second you shave from the actions it takes to help you, the more likely you will be helped. In this example, all your contact has to do is forward this to your desired_person, and ask if they’d be interested in engaging with you. If yes, they’d just have to cc them on this original thread.
-   Second, do your research! If this person works in your space, have they produced any work that you benefitted from (like a blogpost on how to use a technology that you learned from)? Many companies have engineering blogs. It’s helpful to go read some posts to see what they’ve been up to and thinking about… who knows they could actually help you, and you now have something to spur a discussion. If you can’t find someone that you’ve learned from, then just skip this line. It’s quite obvious when you’re attempting to fake a common talking point. From my experience it doesn’t work when it’s not genuine. Your mileage may vary.
-   **Be straightforward about your motivation:** you’re looking for a job, you think you have the right background for it, and you’d like to chat to see if there’s a fit. From my experience, it helps to be direct about this, because who are you kidding, it’s clear you want a job at their company. They know you want a job at their company. **There’s no need to beat around the bush**. People can easily notice hidden motivations.
-   Then you ask them for a coffee (if possible). You choose a location that’s very convenient for them. You propose a time, which makes it really easy for them to know if they’re available then: they open their calendar. In case they’re busy at that time, you’ve made it easy for them to see when they are available - since they already have their calendar open in front of them. Once again: **make it easy for people to help you!** “If not, I’m happy to work around your schedule, so feel free to propose any other time.” - may seem a bit too passive, but is likely to come off as valuing their time. You’re making it clear that you value their time more than your own.
-   **In your signature** you have a link to your website, which should have more information about your past work. This makes it easy for your recipient to know what your background is - to gauge if they could actually help you, without having to chat with you. This may seem counterintuitive, but if someone is unsure whether they can help you, or whether you have the potential to be a good fit, they’re unlikely to give you any of their time - especially a 10-30 minute commitment like a coffee. If they do want to find out more about you, they’d have to Google you, which can be a lot of effort. Make it easy for your recipient to dig into your past work and how you could bring value to their team.

  

**Finding your network**

Use LinkedIn to find **people that are** **2nd / 3rd degrees apart from you**. You can do this by following this: [LinkedIn guide](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/4326/searching-your-connection-s-connections?lang=en). Once you’ve found people that you’re 2nd degree connected to, see the common connection and request an introduction from them. 

  

With all of these suggestions, your mileage may vary. You might feel some other wording could work better, and should experiment with your messaging and say what you would naturally say. The goal of the example is to provide you with something to work off of in case you get stuck.

  

Reach out to **every single human being** that you know that seems to have the slightest chance of knowing someone at a company that’s looking to hire technical talent. Introductions are the most effective way to get your foot in the door at companies. You don’t won’t know unless you ask.

## **Online Platforms**

There are quite a few online platforms where you can create profiles of yourself and apply to companies directly through the platform.

  

Tips when creating profiles:

-   follow guidelines in Selling to tailor your online profiles to communicate your value to companies
-   Make your email address easily discoverable through any online profile. While this increases spam, it also gives you more leads to work with.

  

A few platforms to get started with:

-   [**Angellist**](http://angellist.com) (can filter by role)
-   [**LinkedIn**](http://linkedin.com)
-   [**Hired**](http://hired.com)
-   [**Glassdoor**](http://glassdoor.com)

## **Credential blind platforms**

There exist platforms like TripleByte and Interviewing.io that give you a shot to interview at companies, given you have the technical chops.

  

With [**TripleByte**](http://triplebyte.com)**,** you can take their online programming quiz, which if you pass, you then interview with TripleByte onsite (they’ll fly you out). If you pass that, they’ll fast-track you to onsite interviews at a bunch of companies. This can be especially useful if you don’t have a traditional background and your resume gets filtered out at a large percentage of companies you apply to. 

  

With [**Interviewing.io**](http://interviewing.io)**,** you can have an anonymous (you don’t reveal who you are) mock technical phone screens with engineers from companies looking to hire. You get feedback, and have the option to reveal yourself to the engineer that interviewed you and potentially move on to the next round at the company.

  

These approaches take advantage of your interviewing competence, and can get you interviews even if you have a non-traditional learning path that filters out your resume.

## **Directly applying online**

The most obvious way to apply to a company is to apply through their online application portal. Since it’s the most obvious, it also has the least chance for success by itself. It’s helpful to augment an online application with another application channel discussed, such as cold outreach, or warm introduction.

  

We’ve seen that it can take up to 3 weeks for some companies to get back to you.

  

**Resources to find companies to apply to:**

-   Github [Repository of easy application companies](https://github.com/j-delaney/easy-application). 
-   [breakoutlist.com](https://interviewing.io/): this site predicts which companies are going to be breakout successes. A good source to learn about up and coming companies that you might not have come across on more traditional platforms.

## **Events**

Companies like to host or sponsor events. You can find out about company events on platforms like:

-   [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/)
-   [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/)
-   Google “**<company_name>**” events. Companies talk about their events on their websites, which should pop up with this search.

  

**What kind of events to go to**

If you’ve worked with a particular technology or language, it helps to go to events around that. This way, you’ll start off with a common talking point: the technology that both of you have used. Employees oftentimes attend events to find people to bring onto their teams. If they’re at a Python event, they probably want to bring on board software engineers that are effective in Python.

  

**Approaching people at events** can be daunting. If you’re not a natural conversationalist, it can help to prepare an introduction that you can use when you interact with a stranger at an event. Just know that the purpose of an event is to bring people together. People should generally be expecting others to approach and start conversations, if they’re not doing it themselves.

  

You could use a common introduction like: “Hey, my name’s Anne, I’m here to check out the talk on <insert talk>. I’m trying to learn more about <insert technology>. What brings you here?”. 

## **Career Fairs**

Career fairs are typically hosted by universities in which candidates (usually students at the university where it’s held) can engage with many companies at once. Companies set up booths at the venue, and as a candidate you can go up to the booths, chat with a company representative: usually a recruiter and/or an engineer/engineering manager, to chat with them about your background, ask any questions you may have, and hand in your resume.

  

This can be an extremely valuable way to meet companies and communicate how you can deliver value to them - in person.

  

If your school has a career fair, attend it. Even if the companies attending aren’t that stellar, and you may not want to work at those companies, it helps to practice putting yourself out there and pitching yourself. And who knows, you may find a company interesting after you chat with a representative. 

  

Regardless of whether your school has a career fair or not, it can help to attend a career fair of a university that’s more “reputable” than yours - i.e. ranks higher in computer science or is known to produce good software engineers. One way to find colleges that likely have bigger career fairs, with more exciting companies visiting, is to look at the [US New’s college computer science program rankings](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings). Find ones that are feasible for you to make a trip out to and visit.

  

**Tips on getting into career fairs at schools you don’t attend:**

-   Public schools seem to be more lenient when it comes to letting outsiders in. [x].
-   Dress professionally, to seem like you belong at the career fair.
-   Do you research online: college career fairs usually have websites with guidelines, list of companies attending, etc.
-   Share your story with another student attending the fair and see if they can help you get in somehow.
-   Honestly helps: explaining that you don’t attend the school, that your school doesn’t have a great career fair and you are genuinely interested in meeting companies and getting a career in Tech, and that you’d greatly appreciate a chance - is a powerful way to persuade people to help.

  

In a couple of scenarios we’ve seen, it’s relatively straightforward to simply walk into the career fair if you dress professionally and give off the vibe that you’re genuinely there to connect with companies and learn.

  

​​Be prepared to not be allowed inside.

  

**Optimizing your time**

Career fairs can have a lot of companies and really long lines of students hoping to hand in their resume and have a conversation with a recruiter or engineer there. If you don’t have a strategy, you could spend most of your time in lines and not get a chance to meet all of the companies that attend. 

  

**Suggestions:**

-   Understand when the peak time are: usually the middle half of the event. Try to go to the popular companies outside of these peak times. 
-   Early in the day - at the opening helps since company reps are mentally fresh and aren’t yet bombarded by a ton of students.
-   At the end of career fairs, the student crowd dies out, and company reps take time to close up their booths. This can be a great opportunity to introduce yourself to companies, offer your help in putting stuff away and give them your resume. Basically don’t leave until everyone else is gone. Sometimes they may be too exhausted - gauge the situation and adapt.

  

**Approaching companies at the career fair**

Oftentimes companies have both recruiters and engineers at the company booths. Remember that recruiters typically don’t have technical backgrounds. If you have something exciting (product wise / technical) to share about a past project or experience, you should meet the engineer, since the recruiter likely won’t want to hold a deep product or technical conversation about past work. 

  

If you’re at the front of the line and you notice the recruiter is about to call the next person before the engineer, you can kindly ask the person behind you to swap. If that doesn’t work, go ahead and meet the recruiter, and then try to connect with the engineer afterwards (after the crowd dies down).

## **Cold outreach**

Let’s say you want to apply to a company, but don’t have any contact that can introduce you to someone there. You can directly reach out to employees at companies and ask to chat. While this generally has a lower chance of response compared to a warm introduction from a mutual connection (see <introductions> above), it can be an effective way to connect with people that are outside of your network.

  

**Targeting the right people**

Especially if you don’t have a brand name company on your resume, and if you don’t / didn’t go to a reputed computer science program, **you should focus your cold outreach efforts towards engineers and engineering managers at companies.** Recruiters have a tougher time looking past credentials like a top school or company on your resume, and they are already swamped with a lot of communication. <link to section above that talks about recruiters, engineers and their incentives>.

  

You can find people at companies:

-   **Team page**: smaller companies often have a team page on their site. You can find their name, position on their profile, and Google them to get a more comprehensive picture about them.
-   **LinkedIn:** You can search with a phrase like “engineer <acme_corp>” or “engineering manager <acme_corp>” to see results of people who best meet this criteria. Investing in a LinkedIn premium account really helps with this type of searching.
-   **Google:** Just search for a title at a company, and you’re likely to find some people pop up - either through their personal websites or other platforms.

  

**Getting their email address**

Companies use common email address patterns. You should try either: 

-   <first_letter_of_first_name><last_name>@company.com
-   <first_name>.<last_name@company.com>

  

For example, if the person’s name is Anne Smith, try:

-   asmith@company.com
-   anne.smith@company.com

  

If the company is super small (like under 20 people or so), and / or if this person joined very early (or is a founder), you could also try <first_name>@company.com.

  

In order to speed this up and not rely on trial and error, you could use a service like [RocketReach](https://rocketreach.co/), or its many competitors, to validate email addresses, or to get an email address if you provide a name and a company.

  

**The Email**

It takes time and effort to craft a cold email that will be read and responded to. People can be crazy busy, swamped with deadlines, work-related communication and just work. In order for someone to read your email, respond, AND be willing to put aside 10 - 20 minutes to chat with you is a **huge ask**. Given how big this ask is, you need to do everything you can to maximize the chances that your recipient will accept your proposal.

  

**Be very specific about your ask**

What do you want the recipient to do? How clear have you made it to them about your desired action? If you want to chat with them over coffee to ask advice about something and to pitch what you can bring to their team, have you made this clear to them? How long will the chat be? Where would you meet? Have you proposed some times? 

  

Remember, you want to **reduce the friction** for someone to help you. If you don’t have a specific ask, you place more of a cognitive load on your recipient’s mind - they’ll have questions about how long the chat would be, what you’ve done that would make this worthwhile for them, 

  

**Propose something they want** 

In this context of applying for a job, you are reaching out to engineers / engineering managers that are looking for people to bring onto their teams - to help them achieve their team goals, by helping them build product / fix bugs, or whatever the tasks may be.

  

**Find a common ground**

Do your research. Has this person worked on a technology that you used? Did they go the same college as you? Do you have any mutual connections? Do you share the same hometown? It helps to find some common ground since it makes you less of a random stranger presenting yourself.

  

**Personalize**

People are more likely to respond when they feel like they are uniquely qualified to help you out, and when your message doesn’t feel like it could be sent to someone else by find-and-replacing their name and company with another.

  

**Be thankful**

Value others’ time **greater** than you value your own time. Put your recipient first. Let them know that you’d greatly appreciate their help. Let them know that you know they’re busy and you’re willing to be as flexible as needed on the time and location. Be thankful.

  

**Example cold email**

Let’s say you’re sending a cold email to an engineering manager at AcmeCorp. You’ve done your research and you know their team uses React to build out their map component for their company’s“BikingRoutes”- which is also something that you use regularly when you bike around your city.

  

---

**Subject:** REQUEST: Opportunity to show what I can bring to your team

  

**Body:**

Hey Kim,

  

It looks like I missed you by 3 years at Georgia Tech :).

  

I’d greatly appreciate a chance to chat about how I can help your team deliver a great map interface for BikingRoutes. Are you available for a quick, **15 min coffee** at <coffee spot stupidly close to their office> sometime in the coming weeks? Say this Friday at 3pm? I know you’re busy - I’m to work around your schedule in any way.

  

I’ve built a few projects in React <direct link to projects>. In one, I create an annotated map of NYC that outlined all the possible running paths. You can see reviews for each path when you click on it, which reminded me of the BikingPaths feature that you launched last week.

  

I was hoping to chat with you about how your team uses React for BikingRoutes, to share my work in greater detail and to see if there could be a good fit for me on your team.

  

Regards,

The above example is quite direct: you’re telling the recipient how you can bring value to their team by showing how you’ve built projects in the past that are aligned with what their team is building. 

  

Let’s break it down:

  

-   **Subject:** REQUEST: Opportunity to show what I can bring to your team

  

Imagine that your recipient just woke up to 100 unread emails in their inbox. Yours is one of them. They're going to spend about a second on your subject before making the decision to engage or archive/delete. Your subject line needs to get to the point and help them understand the potential value in spending more time on this email.

  

It can help to start your subject line with“REQUEST”or“ASK”,to make it clear that you’re asking the recipient for something. 

  

In this case, your subject line paints the potential of a new teammate that can help them achieve their team goals.

  

Common college: this person went to the same school, and you saw on their LinkedIn that they graduate 3 years before you started, so you simply mention it here. You’re less of a stranger from the recipient’s perspective. If this seems a bit too unnecessary for you, and not something you’d normally say, you should leave it out.

  

-   Are you available for a quick, **15 min coffee** at <coffee spot stupidly close to their office> sometime in the coming weeks? Say this Friday at 3pm?

  

This makes it very clear what the time commitment would be - about 20 - 25 minutes when the walk to the coffee shop is factored in. 

  

By proposing a time: Friday @3pm, you reduce the recipient’s cognitive load. Rather than mentally think about when they’d want to meet(assumingthey already see the value in meeting), they simply open their calendar and look at Friday @3pm. If it’s blocked, they already have their calendar open and can look at the other available times and propose an alternative.

  

-   I know you’re busy - I’m to work around your schedule in any way.

  

You communicate to the recipient that their time is more valuable than yours. 

  

-   I’ve built a few projects in React <direct link to projects>. In one, I create an annotated map of NYC that outlined all the possible running paths.

  

You show work that you’ve done that demonstrates that you can provide value to the team - because it’s similar to the product that this team has built. Check out the <how to create personal website> guidelines on how to best present your projects. 

  

-   You can see reviews for each path when you click on it, which reminded me of the BikingPaths feature that you launched last week.

  

A direct comparison to their latest shipped feature that’s similar to your project. You’ve done your homework.

  

-   I was hoping to chat with you about how your team uses React for BikingRoutes, to share my work in greater detail and to see if there could be a good fit for me on your team.

  

You’re transparent about your motivations. You want to learn, and you want to demonstrate competence to see if there could be a fit.

-   Regards,

-     
    

-   <your name>,

-   w: <link to your website>

-   c: <your phone number>

  

The final signature makes it easy for the recipient to dig into your previous work and learn more about you if they choose. Typically, before someone commits spending 30 minutes with you, they’re going to spend a few minutes to understand you better, what you want and think about whether this engagement would be beneficial enough to them to warrant the time. And sometimes they may even want to help you without expecting anything in return. 

  

Regardless, always make it easy for people to learn more about you and your past work.

  

This sample email is a starting point to get you thinking about how you can draft a cold email that works.

  

**Notes**

Be prepared to not have a high response rate. Cold emails are tough. But as you refine your message, your subject lines, understand your recipients better, and experiment with messaging that works, you should see improvement. [x]

## **Out of the box approaches**

OK, so you’re trying the above approaches with moderate success. Maybe it’s getting boring and you want to spice up your life a little bit. Here are some approaches that you may not have considered, but can be extremely effective when executed appropriately.

  

**Walking into office buildings**

You could print out your resume, cover letter, walk into an office building and drop it off at the front-desk saying it’s for <person of interest> at company. 

  

Sometimes this will backfire: if you’ve already cold emailed someone, and then dropped off a letter + resume at their office for them, it may not be received well, and you’d come off as too aggressive.

  

I’ve seen this work well when the company you’re applying to is really in a need for talent. Ideally this is a startup that has just raised a series A and is looking to aggressively hire. They’re not able to meet their hiring needs as quickly as they’d like, and they aren’t well known yet, meaning there aren’t many inbound applications. **This is your opportunity.** In this context, going to their office in person, politely explaining at the front desk that you’d like to introduce yourself to the team to see if you could be a fit in their engineering department gives you a much higher chance of success.

  

You can find companies that just raised their series A by searching on [Crunchbase](http://crunchbase.com) / [Angellist](http://angellist.com) and keeping an eye out for news on sites such as [Techcrunch](http://techcrunch.com). A few times in a year startup accelerators like [YCombinator](http://ycombinator.com), 500Startups, [Angelpad](https://angelpad.com/), [Techstars](https://www.techstars.com/), etc. graduate batches of companies. Typically soon after these graduations, the companies raise a round of funding to expand their teams. That’s a good time to reach out to them.

  

**Networking through orthogonal interests**

If you find yourself in a location with a high density of companies, founders and employees, you’re likely to run into them at recreational events in the city. 

  

For example, I played a lot of basketball growing up, and dare I say, I think I’m pretty good. I moved to San Francisco soon after I got my first job out of school and balled a lot at courts around the city. I ended up meeting many people that were working on cool projects or at cool companies. 

  

I garnered respect for my ability to play well and help teams win [pickup basketball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick-up_game) games. I would also give people suggestions and advice when asked about certain things related to basketball. I’d then also ask them things about their work and advice on projects that I was working on outside of bball. I noticed that people I met through basketball were far more willing to help me than those that I had met outside - say at Tech events, etc. 

  

I believe this is because I had already formed a bond with these people on the court, garnered respect for basketball ability, and helped them out with something before asking them about non-basketball related advice, introductions, etc. Respect in basketball translated to respect and willingness to help off the court.

  

A simpler way to explain this: just make friends in whatever situations you naturally make friends in, without worrying about Tech jobs, etc. and then ask your friends who’s in Tech if they’re looking to bring on board someone with your skills / if they can introduce you to others they may know that are looking to hire.

  

**Moving to a high density area**

If you’re looking for a Tech job, it really helps to move to a Tech hub. It maximizes serendipitous encounters with future teammates, managers, recruiters, etc. And it makes meeting people in person a lot more efficient. There’s no better way to help people

  

**Prioritization**

If you studied at not a well known school, or if you don’t have brand name companies on your resume, there’s a greater chance for your resume to not get past the recruiter when you apply directly to companies. Therefore, it helps to prioritize approaches that help you get your foot in the door regardless of your resume: attending events, career fairs, getting introductions to engineers, cold emailing, etc.

## **Organization**

When you’re applying to many companies, you’ll have a lot of logistical, organizational work such as replying to recruiters, setting up phone screens, making sure you follow up quickly on introductions, etc. Chaos leads to forgetting about things you need to do.

  

It’s helpful to organize your work in a spreadsheet so that you know what the open action items are that you need to do.

  

The spreadsheet can be very simple. Example: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16BIlx1Zyg8oeZokB2avhCAv9ZkcYUCRpKKt9FnnFjXA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16BIlx1Zyg8oeZokB2avhCAv9ZkcYUCRpKKt9FnnFjXA/edit?usp=sharing).

  

This spreadsheet has the following columns:

**Company**

**Contact**

**Role**

**LinkedIn**

**Notes**

**Action items**

  

Helps you keep track of who you’re engaging with at a company, along with their background information such as their LinkedIn profile, and what you need to do next “Action items”. Oftentimes your action item will simply be waiting for a response. 

  

This helps you stay on top of your process. If you’re willing, you could also add more detail to this sheet to help you measure your funnel of applications → phone screen → onsite → offer, to identify the areas to focus on to improve your interview process. (read <How a Company Assesses you>).

TODO:

-   talk about how we HATE using things like GPA to gauge potential and that it’s been shown in studies that gpa has absolutely nothing to do with potential —> but remember, we’re optimizing our pitch based on what companies are looking for… man, now I’m torn on this → **if you over-optimize for what companies are looking for, you might lose your voice, which is way more important than getting a job** **(imho)**. - help shed light on what really matters in the long-run.

# Primers

## **Email 101**

Email is still the most widely used professional communication medium. You’ll most likely use email as part of your communication with companies at some point in the application process.

  

Email Anatomy:

**Subject:** A one liner explaining to the recipient what your email is about, and WHY they should even bother opening it.

**Body:** Your message

**Signature:** You information that appears at the end of an email. Typically signed off as:

---

sincerely/regards/cheers,

  

<your name>

you role,

company

contact information (i.e. website, phone number, etc.)

---

  

Sending options

**Carbon copy** **(CC)**: Those you CC will also involved in the email thread you start. Everyone on an email thread can see everyone that has been CC’d.

**Blind carbon copy** **(BCC)**: Those you BCC will also be in the thread.

**Topics to add:**

-   For the **email introductions** section, emphasize how you need to follow up quickly - since someone is doing YOU a favor and introducing you to someone.
-   ~~Make sure to communicate how much companies want engineers - as much as engineers want companies. Know what you’re worth.~~
-   How to write a great email subject line.
-   **References**: for a lot of the topics, I have personal references that I learned off of. I should suggest those as part of it.
-   **Email 101** in the primer: have 30s sending delay → really helps when you’ve accidentally sent something.

**Email 101:**

Need to have a section on how to generally communicate with people via email. I feel like people just don’t know… and it’s understandable, there’s not much content out there outside of the “how to run sales outreach” guides that actually tech effective communication. Figure out where to talk about this.

-   Just came here to write this again lol. Clearly email ettiquette needs a section of its own. As well as helping people understand how cluttered peoples’ email inboxes can become. It’s important to craft emails the right way, and understand what CC, BCC, all mean in communication. As much as we’d like to see email go away, it’s still the most widely used professional communication medium. I don’t see it going away anytime soon.
