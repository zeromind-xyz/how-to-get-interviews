Open source projects are ones in which the source code is open to the world, and can be used in other projects (according to the project license).

Open source projects can be a great way to demonstrate your ability to create value to a project that has users because of its inherent open nature: any work you contribute to a project can be showcased to others, unlike work for a private company where you usually can't display the code you wrote to the world.

I recommend against starting your own open source project and to instead contribute to one that already has usage because getting users for an unkown project is tougher and more time consuming than contributing to an already established project. Without users for your project, it won't demonstrate your competence (because competence is measured by the outcomes you're able to generate, not on the complexity of your codebase or some other metric). (TODO: reword this to be simpler & flow better).

Effectively ontributing to existing open source projects is a skillset that maps very well to contributing to a company's codebase. Both require understanding an exsiting codebase and working with other engineers to improve it.

### Choose the right project

Contributing to a very popular project (e.g. tens of thousands of stars on Github), is powerful verifiable proof of competence, but it can also take a long time to make the contribution. Popular projects can be complex, requiring a lot of time to understand and make sense of the codebase in order to contribute, and have a high bar for acceptance: the maintainers are incredible engineers that want to ensure (rightly so) that their project doesn't become unnecessarily complex with mediocre code / abstractions.

If you want to start with something smaller, you could look for projects that have reasonable traction (e.g. hundreds of stars on Github), but are created and maintained by non-engineers. Researchers from various fields fields publish a codebase alongside their research papers - in order to replicate the paper or as a proof of concept for something described in the paper. If the paper is popular, the codebase gets usage.

These researchers often need engineering help to clean up the project, use better abstractions, port over their library to a more recent version of a programming language for compatability purposes, have better user interfaces to be used by non-programmers, etc. These are tasks that are often independent of the underlying science: so you don't need to be an AI expert to make meaningful contributions to a proof of concept AI project by a researcher.

These kinds of project owners usually welcome free engineering help, and will likely be helpful in getting you up to speed quickly.

Choosing projects that you actually use is another way to speed up the contribution process. Familiarity with a software library will make it easier for you to understand what could be improved / fixed.

### Choose the right angle

There are many ways to contribute to a project. You can build new features, fix bugs, optimize for performance, refactor to make it easy to build on top of, etc.

You can find open items by looking at the issues/ tab for a project on Github, checking out the project Wiki / discussion threads, and even by searching for "TODO"s in the repo itself.

Before jumping in and contributing, try to find the low hanging fruits: that don't take too much effort, but create a lot of value. It could be small cleanups / refactors that improve readability. Or adding test cases to an error prone part of the codebase.

Starting small helps you build familiarity with the codebase, build a track record with the project maintainers, get a sense for the priorities of the project, and participate in community discusions for how to improve things.

Once you have a good grasp of the codebase, try and pick up the highest impact work that you can accomplish within a week, or at the most two - based on your skillset and understanding of the codebase. 

Picking small bite-sized pieces pushes you to actually complete it. It can be very easy to pick up a big chunk of work only to start losing motivation 3 weeks into it having nothing to show for it. This kind of effort is a waste of time and doesn't help you build verifiable proof of competence.

### Presentation

Unfortunately, just showing a link that has all of your commits for a project undersells what you've done (e.g. https://github.com/ProseMirror/prosemirror/commits?author=marijnh) because it doesn't tie your work to outcomes.

I recommend creating a landing page / document that encapsulates your open source contributions, grouped by outcomes. For example, if you have a group of 3 commits that refactored the code to make it significantly easier to build a category of features, then you should mention that impact. Under each impact description add links to the commits that contributed to that impact.

This landing page doesn't have to be anything fancy. You can even just use a Notion page / single document. Can use large headers for each open source project, with a list descriptions: one for each outcome, and links to commits under each outcome.

### Solicit testimonials

Once you've contributed meaningfully to a project, you can ask the project maintainer for a 
testimonial.

When asking for a testimonial, don't expect the project maintainer to be intimately familiar with the work you've done. You can send a link to the document you created above that groups commits by outcomes and summarizes the work you've done.

Politely ask them for a testimonial and feel free to share your motivations: that you're job hunting and want to leverage this experience to help you land a job.

Later in the "Outreach" section we'll go over approaches to build your network. Open source project maintainers are great people to connect and befriend - after all you worked with them to build something, hence they're likely to respond and engage with you. Follow the guidelines in (todo: Link to "Leverage your network") to learn how to approach them and run a successful "Warm up" meeting.
