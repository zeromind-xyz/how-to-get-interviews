Open source projects are ones in which the source code is open to the world, and can be used in other projects (according to the project license).

Open source projects can be a great way to demonstrate your ability to create value to a project that has users because of its inherent open nature: any work you contribute to a project can be showcased to others, unlike work for a private company where you usually can't display the code you wrote to the world.

I recommend against starting your own open source project and to instead contribute to one that already has usage because getting users for an unkown project is tougher and more time consuming than contributing to an already established project. Without users for your project, it won't demonstrate your competence (because competence is measured by the outcomes you're able to generate, not on the complexity of your codebase or some other metric). (TODO: reword this to be simpler & flow better).

### Choose the right project

Contributing to a very popular project (e.g. tens of thousands of stars on Github), is powerful verifiable proof of competence, but it can also take a long time to make the contribution. Popular projects can be complex, requiring a lot of time to understand and make sense of the codebase in order to contribute, and have a high bar for acceptance: the maintainers are incredible engineers that want to ensure (rightly so) that their project doesn't become unnecessarily complex with mediocre code / abstractions.

If you want to start with something smaller, you could look for projects that have reasonable traction (e.g. hundreds of stars on Github), but are created and maintained by non-engineers. Researchers from various fields fields publish a codebase alongside their research papers - in order to replicate the paper or as a proof of concept for something described in the paper. If the paper is popular, the codebase gets usage.

These researchers often need engineering help to clean up the project, use better abstractions, port over their library to a more recent version of a programming language for compatability purposes, have better user interfaces to be used by non-programmers, etc. These are tasks that are often independent of the underlying science: so you don't need to be an AI expert to make meaningful contributions to a proof of concept AI project by a researcher.

These kinds of project owners usually welcome free engineering help, and will likely be helpful in getting you up to speed quickly.

Choosing projects that you actually use is another way to speed up the contribution process. Familiarity with a software library will make it easier for you to understand what could be improved / fixed.

### Choose the right angle

There are many ways to contribute to a project, 
- Actually start using the library / product. Become a user (if you aren't already).
	- Issue tracker
	- TODOs in code
	- Follow the discussion.

### How to contribute

(Just reference an existing blogpost / essay that covers this. No need to re-invent the wheel obv).
- http://blog.davidecoppola.com/2016/11/howto-contribute-to-open-source-project-on-github/ (seems reasonable enough).

### Presentation

Unfortunately, just showing a link that has all of your commits for a project undersells what you've done (e.g. https://github.com/ProseMirror/prosemirror/commits?author=marijnh). 

You can build a landing page for your open source commits that you group by outcome.

For example, if you have a group of 3 commits that refactored the code to make it significantly easier to build a category of features, then you should mention that impact.

This landing page doesn't have to be anything fancy. You can even just use a Notion page / single document. Big headers for each open source project you've contributed to. And inside of them the main **outcomes** you drove with your commits. You should link to the commits from this document as well, so that if the reader wants to see the actual code behind it, it's just a click away.

A landing page also gives you the ability to add testimonials from the project owners that should 

(TODO: how to ask for a testimonial -> That's an important skill)
