A company tailored project is one that is optimized for a single company in which you improve the company's product or service.

This is the **most powerful proof of competence** to have when applying to a company because you're showing that you can do the work you'd do there if you were hired, **before** you're hired. You're also showing that you care about what they're doing and that you want to be a part of their mission.

The downside to this approach is that it's expensive: it can take some time to build a project for a single company before you apply to them so I'd restrict this approach to the companies that you really, really want to work at and that are hiring urgently (TODO: link to "Find and qualifying companies chapter").

Fortunately in Tech, many companies have products that are out in the open for you to play with, inspect and analyze to see how to improve it. 

If you can, restrict this approach to the companies that have products that you use on a regular basis because you've done most of the tough work already: having a sense for the audience for a product and how it can be made better for that audience - because you've already used it!

### Written proposal

This is a write-up of a problem you notice in the company's product, and how you'd go about fixing it.

- Show proof of the problem: customer support questions / personal experience / finding and talking to other users of the product to validate the problem and gather more evidence.
- What approach would you take to solve it and why you think it's the best approach (given your understanding of the problem)
- Any pictures / diagrams / API specs / mockups / designs that help you communicate your solution more tangibly.

### Demo-able Prototype

In addition to the written proposal for a solution, build a prototype of the solution itself.
