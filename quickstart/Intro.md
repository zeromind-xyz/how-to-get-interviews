Over the past few years, I've helped dozens of engineers strategize and execute successful job hunting campaigns.  

I've noticed that most people don't understand the art of job hunting. I feel sad when I see an engineer who's technically sound, spends hours practicing interview questions, and yet fails to even get interviews to able to showcase their competence that they've worked so hard to craft. 

A tragedy.

**For most of you, your biggest challenge isn't interviewing, it's getting interviews.**  

This playbook is a framework that will consistently generate interviews.

### Who is this for?

This playbook is for you if you are a college student (or self-learner) / new grad / junior software engineer with 0 - 2 years of experience, haven't had internships at prestigious Tech companies and therefore are struggling to get interviews at the companies you want to work at.

### How long will it take to start getting interviews?

This depends on your starting point. If you have no company work experience (or experience at companies no one's heard of), AND have no meaningful projects that you've built, then you aren't ready to pitch yourself yet.

Job hunting effectively boils down to having a powerful sales pitch and knowing how to apply that pitch. A pitch requires having something that is worth pitching.

If you have nothing worthwhile that you've done to showcase your abilities, then you'll likely spend more time in the "prepare" section of this playbook that shows you how to choose and build a project that demonstrates your abilities effectively, and how to pitch that project.

If you don't have the ability to build a project (e.g. a simple CRUD application even), then it might take you a bit longer.

On the other hand, if you already have a project, and / or impressive previous work experience, you'll be ready to hit the ground running.

It's tough to give concrete timelines because of differences between individuals in learning rate, but I'd bet that if you know how to build simple applications, then you should be able to create an impressive project in 2 - 6 weeks of intense, focused, dedicated effort. 

Before you start creating / fine-tuning your project, you ought to first understand how companies hire, what they look for and what makes a project impressive in the eyes of those looking to hire engineers. With this knowledge, you'll save a lot of time building what actually matters rather than wasting time creating a project that no one cares about. The first two sections of this playbook ("Rules of the game", and "prepare") will help you understand this. 

### Why me?

I have a non-traditional background: while I went to a top computer science program, I left college without graduating - moved out to SF and joined an early stage startup that I was excited to work at. After that startup experience, in the process of job hunting for my second job, I quickly learned that the standard approach of "apply to companies and wait" was the absolute worst way to job hunt.

My circumstances forced me to explore a variety of tactics to get noticed by companies that I wanted to work at. Through cold emails, warm introductions, Twitter DMs, and even walking into companies to chat with them about open positions - I was able to successfully get interviews despite not having an impressive resume at that point in my career.

I used my experience to help friends radically improve their job hunting campaigns. I hope this system will serve you as well.

The art of job hunting is a skill that keeps giving. The ability to pitch yourself well will continue to unlock opportunities for you throughout life. At its core, this playbook shows you the mindset you need to pro-actively create opportunities for yourself no matter what your objective is.

Lastly, I can't take full credit for the strategies I've outlined in this book. I'm incredibly grateful for my friends and colleagues that have taught me how to effectively job hunt from their hard-fought experiences, and those that have given me detailed feedback on versions of this playbook. Thank you.

From the bottom of my heart I wish that you're able to build a career that brings you great fulfillment and happiness. All the best.
