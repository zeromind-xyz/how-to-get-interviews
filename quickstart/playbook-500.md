Companies hire people to help them serve their customers better, to generate greater revenue. Therefore applying to companies is about pitching yourself to convince them that you can create value for them.

If you don't have a strong brand name on your resume (prestigious institution / past work experience), the best approach is to bypass the recruiter entirely and find ways to connect with engineers & engineering managers at the companies you want to work at.

Build verifiable proof of competence: work that you've done that clearly demonstrates your ability to create value for companies. Build this by either contributing to open source projects that already have users, or building your own project and getting users for it.

If you can't build even a simple working application / contribute to an open source project, learn how to do that first.

Verifiable = people don't have to believe you and can dig into source code, and see social proof from 3rd party platforms: stars on Github, testimonials on twitter, app reviews / number of downloads on app stores.

Users, not code complexity, is what makes your work impressive. Create value for others to demonstrate your ability to create value for companies.

Talk to every single person you know that works in Tech. Pay for coffees / hop on calls and genuinely connect with them. Understand what they're up to, what they're excited about, etc. Be transparent: share with them your job hunting journey, proof of competence and ask for advice. Ask for introductions to at least 2 of their engineer / engineering manager friends at other companies. Repeat the process for each of those connections.

If you can effectively build relationships, you should be able to grow your network through such introductions. Eventually you'll connect with engineers at companies that are actively hiring and they will help get you an interview if your proof of competence is good enough, else they'll help you understand how to improve your proof of competence.

Next, build a list of companies to apply to. Choose the ones that are hiring urgently (have many job openings in addition to engineering roles), and where you think you can create value: you'll be able to contribute to their product with minimal learning curve.

Find engineers / engineering managers at each of these companies and cold email them w/ your proof of competence asking for an opportunity to demonstrate how you can create value for them.

Do whatever you can to get noticed by the companies you really want to work at. Drop into their office with your resume in hand, physically mail your resume + cover letter to hiring managers at companies. Move to a tech hub and make friends at cafes, parties, etc. 

Hustle hard, but don't appear desparate. Know your worth: if you can build a working application, you're better than 99% of engineers on the market.

By building verifiable proof of competence, growing your network and reaching out to companies through engineers / engineering managers, you will get interviews and eventually land a job.
