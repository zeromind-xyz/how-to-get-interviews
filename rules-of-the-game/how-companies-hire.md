A "company" is a fictional entity that's approximately valued by how much profits it can generate. 

It creates value by making something people want and selling it to them & hires people to enable the company to create greater value.

Therefore, fundamentally, convincing a company to hire you boils demonstrating your ability to SHOW the company that you can create value for them.

Generally, you'll go through the following steps when you apply to a company:
1. Added the the Applicant Tracking System (ATS).
2. Screened by a recruiter.
3. Screened by the hiring manager.
4. Technical screening.
5. Interviews with engineers.
6. Behavioral interview (usually with the hiring manager)
7. Offer.

A recruiter is someone who's usually not technical and is responsible for managing the hiring process from sourcing candidates, setting up interviews with the technical team, to handing the offer to the candidate and answering any question they may have. Basically, at any step of your interview process with a company, the recruiter you're working with will be your primary point of contact with that company.

Companies hire recruiters to manage this hiring process because it's an incredibly time consuming and involved skill. While at early stage companies, often the engineers or the founders themselves will identify the right candidates and go through the entire hiring process to interview them and bring them onboard, as the company scales it becomes increasingly difficult to put the burden of recruiting on the engineering team themselves - after all, engineers are hired to... engineer, not spend all their time on the hiring pipeline.

While recruiters manage the entire process, they typically don't have significant say in the final decision of whether to hire you or not - that's up to the team that you'll actually work with. Yet, I've seen cases in which recruiters can veto a candidate because they were disrespectful to the recruiter or had some other major red flag that didn't have anything to do with their engineering competence. Be respectful human being. 

A hiring manager for a job opening is usually the manager for the team that the role is in. They're the ones you'll be working with if you get and accept the offer from this company. In order to make the final decision on whether to hire you, the hiring manager helps the team synthesize their evaluations of you (based on your technical interviews with the team), in order to reach a decision.

Some larger Tech companies (like Google) have hiring committees that also include engineers that didn't actually interview you to help make the final hiring decision, in order to reduce bias in their decision making.

An ATS is the system that companies use to keep track of their applicant pool. It collects applicant information, lets the company sort and search for candidates that have particular skills / experience. Some ATS systems also have "intelligent" filtering that rejects applicants based on the lack of specific terms that the team is looking for in candidates, without even letting the application get to the recruiter / hiring manager for a human review. 

While this the most common process you'll encounter, there's quite a bit of variance in how this plays out at companies based on factors like size, location, culture, etc. Let's understand these nuances so that we can develop a strategy to maximize chance of getting interviews at any company.

### What companies look for

It's incredibly difficult to evaluate actual competence. The only way to do so is to have the candidate work at the company on a trial period for a month (ideally longer) and then evaluate how they performed. A completely infeasible approach to interviewing candidates.

Even multiple technical interviews are incredibly expensive for a company.

Therefore companies look for "signals" of competence: achievements / qualities of a job candidate that correlate with competence and reduces the risk of the candidate lacking the skills needed to create value at the company.

Due to the huge cost of interviewing a candidate, and the even larget cost of hiring someone who's not good enough, companies focus on **minimizing risk** in hiring. 

For most companies, it's OK if they pass diamonds in the rough who don't look great on paper, but have actual skills, as long as they don't hire someone who's terrible. 

From a company's perspective, what reduces the risk in taking a bet on a candidate? This actually depends on who in the company is screening your application. 

Recruiters are usually non-technical, so they primarily look at whether a candidate:
1. Graduated from a presitious institution that has a track record for producing strong software engineers.
2. Previously worked at a company with a strong reputation.
3. Is recommended by someone at the company.
4. Has any notable awards related to tech / engineering.

Engineers on the other hand are also able to look at parts of your application that recruiters usually find it difficult to gauge:
- Projects that you've worked on in the past.
- Your open source contributions.
- Your public blog / essays / videos in which you talk about things that are relevant to what this company is working on.

This is why many talented engineers from non-traditional backgrounds get screened out of the hiring process at the ATS / recruiter stage before their application ever gets to engineers: they don't have the signals that recruiters know how to make sense of!

### Referrals are the best

A referral is an application that is proposed by a current employee at a company. A referral carries great weight, often strong enough to guarantee an interview for the candidate referred.

But because of the weight a referral carries, it requires the engineer referring a candidate to spend social capital: if they keep referring bad candidates, not only will their referrals be ignored, but they'll be looked at negatively by teammates because their precious time is wasted interviewing incompetent candidates.

On the other hand, referring candidates that are great improves an engineer's social capital: they're seen as a more valuable asset to the team and company.

Therefore, there's an art to asking people you know for referrals that maximizes the chance of them giving you a strong referral. We'll go over this in detail in [[referrals]].

### Pitch to engineers

If you're not hearing back when you apply to companies online, then you need to find a way to pitch yourself to a hiring manager / engineer directly. They are the ones that have the background necessary to be able to evaluate your competence by looking at your pitch from an engineer's perspective.

With the right pitch, you can effectively reach engineers and hiring managers through warm introductions and cold messaging them. We'll craft your pitch in the "prepare" section that we'll use for this direct-to-engineer outreach in the "approach" section.

Hiring processes aren't set in stone. Remember, a company WANTS to hire great engineers. If you can demonstrate that you're a great engineer to the people in the company that have a say in hiring, then you'll be given an interview. 

### Smaller startups

The process we went over usually exists once a company reaches a certain scale: i.e. post 20 - 30 employees.  At smaller startups, usually the founders themselves / engineering leads will carry out the hiring process.

Hiring is a lot tougher for un-established, not well known startups than it is for more recognized companies. Therefore they're more likely to respond to competent candidates that pitch themselves well.

Smaller startups are also often more creative when it comes to their interview processes: there's a growing trend of startups not asking programming puzzles and focusing more on what you can actually do - via take home projects / building software during an interview that resembles the kind of work you'd actually do on the job.

If you're competent at software engineering, but suck at "programming puzzles", I'd suggest increasing the number of smaller startups you apply to (if they're places you'd want to work at ofc).
