Companies exist to create long-term economic value for its shareholders. The way it does this is by creating a product / service that it sells to customers in exchange for money. The more money it makes, the more value it creates.

A company values you proportional to your ability to positively impact its bottom line. Therefore job hunting is essentially the process of selling your abilities. When applying for an opportunity, it's your job to convince the company that you have the ability to create more value than you're getting paid.

After all, if you don't seem like you're going to create more value than the compensation you take, why should a company hire you?

**Job hunting is a sales process**. You must convince companies that hiring you is a solid **business** decision. 

Treating job hunting as a sales process is especially important during recessions, hiring freezes and difficult times - when companies may not have the leeway to train you for years before you actually create value.

**During easy times people are willing to bet on your potential.
During tough times people only bet on what you can do today.**

Prepare your mind for tough times and learn to pitch yourself so well to minimize the negative impact of your external hiring environment.

How does a company hire? There's no standard hiring process that fits all the shapes and sizes of companies you'll encounter. 

A recruiter is a person whose job is to enlist or enroll people as employees.

The larger the company becomes, the more it tends to rely on a team of recruiters to drive the hiring process: from finding candidates, adminstration work (setting up interviews, etc.), handling offers, answering any questions the candidate has in order to close the deal. 

Eventually, as a company scales, its recruiters do everything in the hiring process except for the actual technical interviews.

As companies grow they increasingly rely on recruiters to drive the hiring process because an engineer's minute costs a company a lot more than a recruiter's minute. Companies want to minimize distracting engineers with any tasks that aren't related to working on the actual money making product.

But investing in an in-house recruiting team only makes financial sense when companies reach a certain scale. Therefore you generally see a growing internal recruiter presence as a company scales, with smaller startups (< 30 employees) typically having no recruiters, to larger tech companies having a mature internal recruitment team with a clearly defined process.

Having to deal with a recruiter may or may not be beneficial to you depending on whether you look "traditionally good" on paper. 

"Traditionally good" = you have a degree from a well known computer science college program, 
you worked at a well-known company.

From a recruiter's perspective, their main aim is to fill open positions as quickly as possible, with the minimum number of candidates interviewed. Interviewing a candidate is quite expensive. It takes an engineer's time to set up interviews, and evaluate a candidate's performance. Smaller companies especially feel the pain when a candidate goes through the entire interview process only to not get an offer at the end of the day, or reject an offer - valuable resources wasted for a company.

Therefore, not only is a recruiter trying to fill a spot quickly, they're also trying to maximize the probability of a candidate actually passing the interview and accepting an offer. Companies want you to pass their interviews! Once they give you an interview that is. 

OK but a recruiter isn't technical, so how can they tell if you have the competence to pass an interview or not? This is where it gets tough if you don't look "traditionally good" on paper.

(something about how the recruiter ends up being the first screening point).

If you look traditionally good on paper then a recruiter knows you're low risk since many people with the same credentials as you have performed well in the industry. Not only is it low risk for the recruiter, it's also not their fault if you fail the interview because who can blame the recruiter for passing on someone who worked at, say, Google. 

On the other hand if you don't look "traditionally good" in your resume and a recruiter passes you on to the engineering team asking them to take a look at you, the recruiter runs the risk of looking bad if the engineering team doesn't like your profile - because the recruiter went against the grain to vouch for you.

Companies that filter on this inadequate definition of "traditionally good" will miss out on a lot of talent in the world, but that will only matter to these companies if the pool of "traditionally good" candidates dries up or if they can't afford this pool anymore.

The world operates on risk minimization - increasingly so as an organization gets bigger. Companies aren't out to actively discriminate against you because you didn't go to a top CS program (or don't have a degree). They aren't evil masterminds making sure that only Stanford grads rule the world. They're simply minimizing risk.

A company is designed to generate $. If interviewing someone from a particular background enables the company to hire quickly and get back to building product, they're going to hire them because that's what their incentives push them to do. 

Therefore when pitching yourself to companies, pitch yourself in a way that minimizes the perceived risk in hiring you.

Don't worry though, I'll show you how to penetrate into companies with recruiters screening for "traditionally good". I'll also show you how to identify companies that don't filter in this way.
