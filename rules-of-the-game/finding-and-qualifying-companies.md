## Qualifying

**Prioritization is important** because you don't have infinite time. There are many ways to approach a company to apply: and some approaches take significantly more effort than others. If you're not careful about which companies you put that effort towards, you won't have great results.

You want to maximize your time on the companies where you have the greatest chance of getting an interview.

I recommend prioritizing companies on two factors: **urgency** (how badly they need to hire) and **fit** (how well your abilities align with what the company is looking for).

### Urgency
You can tell if a company needs to urgently hire if they're growing fast and are barely able to keep up with the demand for their product. You can determine this by whether the company has job openings **across the board** (not just engineering). When a company grows quickly they're not just looking for engineers to build product, but also need to hire for roles like customer support, product, design, sales, legal, etc. This is a great sign that the demand for their product is growing rapidly.

On the other hand, if a company only has one or two openings for engineers, they're not likely to be growing rapidly, and therefore their open roles are less urgent.

### Fit
Fit is inversely proportional to how long it will take you to create value at the company. 

This depends on 2 factors:
1. How closely aligned your experience is with the role description.
2. How well you can do the work.

In the best case scenario, you have extensive experience with the kind of work the company needs to be done, and have deep experience using the tools that the role asks for. If hired, you should be able to hit the ground running with minimal time getting up to speed with the way things work.

Being a high fit for the role you're applying to doesn't necessarily mean you know the exact framework / language that they're using, but rather you've done similar work and can therefore pick up the specific frameworks they're using, quickly. For example, let's say the role asks for knowledge of React, but you're an expert at another web framework similar to React, then your understanding is likely transferrable. Within a couple of weeks you should be able to create value in React.

On the other hand, if you're only familiar with building for the web, then applying to a machine learning engineer position is a low fit: you'll need a lot more time to build the skills to actually create value.

There are also companies with more generalist "full stack" engineering roles. These companies recognize the transerability of strong software engineering skills to any engineering task and are therefore less particular about the exact technology stack you're familiar with. Treat those roles as a medium fit.

Unlike seeing how well you're aligned with the role you're applying to, it's tougher to gauge your actual competence in work. 

### You're undervaluing your abilities!
We tend to overestimate the average and underestimate the extremes. It's both true that the best engineer is 1000x more productive than the average and that the average engineer can't build a meaningful application on their own, without major bugs, in a reasonable amount of time.

If you have baseline competence in software engineering, communication skills, the right attitude (ability to handle feedback well, always working to improve), and some common sense, you're well ahead of the pack. Of course, you'll always have a huge room for improvement and that's what you should focus on, but when it's time to job hunt, don't sell yourself short - it's not a helpful mindset.

I wish everyone reading this gets an opportunity to process hundreds of software engineer job applications from around the world. You'll quickly realize what I mean by overestimating the mean.

Another contributing factor is that those who are dedicated to learning will often consume content from great programmers on Youtube / TikTok / Twitch / Hackernews, etc. When you constantly consume from people who are really good (outliers), it's natural for you to feel inadequate compared to them (I definitely felt this way). Those that are actually learning a lot might be the ones most susceptible to undervaluing their skills. This is great for learning, bad for selling.

I think it's helpful to have some cognitive dissonance: allow yourself to be humbled by the greats on a regular basis and let your "feel" for the average climb. But when it's time to job hunt, turn that system off and have a more realistic gauge of your competence. If in doubt, bias towards greater confidence.

### Urgency <> fit
Let's understand the possible combinations and then see how to actually measure urgency and fit - in order to prioritize well.

**High urgency and high fit**. The company is growing quickly and is trying to hire engineers they needed to hire yesterday. AND you have the skills to actually create value at this company. A dream come true best case scenario.

**High fit and low urgency**. This is mostly Big Tech companies and smaller companies that aren't growing at breakneck pace. These companies don't need to hire like crazy today, but have certain hiring goals they're trying to hit.

Hunting for companies in this section can be fruitful, but also time consuming because there's no strong incentive for the company to move fast. Like humans, companies move fast when it's driven by the fear of survival: i.e. when an opportunity to capture a market exists, and there's pressure to dominate the market or be left with nothing.

This is usually where you'll run into processes that take week(s) - month(s) to result in a decision (assuming you're a decent fit). You should definitely pursue these opportunities if you find companies in this quadrant that you want to work at, but temper your expectations on the speed of the process. There are ways to speed this up which we'll cover later (TODO: link to the section).

**High urgency and low fit**. This is a quadrant that most people don't see the full potential of. It's underrated, but has worked well for a few friends, and it's how I landed my first job out of college.

The thing about companies with high urgency is that they they have a lot of shit to get done. Even if you don't fit into the mold perfectly for a given role, you have more leeway to make the argument that you can create value in a slightly different way that might lie at the intersection of multiple roles.

In my personal case, I knew I wanted to join this particular startup and they were looking for senior Android engineers to help build the OS for a new hardware product.

I barely knew Android development, but I knew I wanted to work with them somehow. After a conversation with the founder, I realized that in addition to building out the OS, they were also engaging with 3rd party app developers to bring them onto the platform (by getting them to launch versions of their apps that would work well on this new OS).

I felt I could do this well because it involved having the combination of technical understanding and pitching / sales. I might not have been the Android expert they were looking for, but I was able to make an argument for the combination of technical ability + sales to help drive a goal they already had.

We ended up on a trial period agreement. If I met certain goals in a month, then I'd be brought on board. Another unsual arrangement that you're unlikely to see at a larger company with more established processes, but worked well for me since I'd much rather be evaluated by actual work over solving coding puzzles that seldom align with real work.

The advantage you have when dealing with companies with urgency is that they have an actual pain that they're hiring to ease. This means that they move faster, and that they tend to be more focused on identifying people who can actually get shit done, rather than over-worry about credentials or the lack thereof. And they're more likely to be open to arrangements such as trial-before-hire, etc.

Many companies that have high urgency also have a wildcard job listing that welcomes you to apply if you feel like you can create value but don't see a specific role listed.

Wildcard listings are becoming more popular these days because of the nature of creating value in Tech: oftentimes the greatest creators of value operate at poorly defined intersection of roles: e.g. the salesperson who can code, the designer who can code, the salesperson who loves design, the engineer who has a strong product sense.

If you have an inclination for such intersections, you might find it easier to operate at intersections of roles at fast growing companies with a high urgency to hire.

Lastly, avoid **low urgency, low fit**.

And of course filter for any other obvious requirements you have: i.e. if you're only willing to work remotely, then... don't apply to an in-person company (and vice-versa).

## Finding companies
