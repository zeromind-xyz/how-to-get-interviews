Job hunting is about selling your abilities to companies. It's your job to demonstrate to companies that you can create value and convince them to hire you.

Companies exist to create long-term economic value for its shareholders. The way it does this is by creating a product / service that it sells to customers in exchange for money. The more money it makes, the more value it creates.

A company values you proportional to your ability to positively impact its bottom line. Therefore job hunting is essentially the process of selling your abilities. When applying for an opportunity, it's your job to convince the company that you have the ability to create more value than you're getting paid.

After all, if you don't seem like you're going to create more value than the compensation you take, why should a company hire you?

**Job hunting is a sales process**. You must convince companies that hiring you is a solid **business** decision. 

Treating job hunting as a sales process is especially important during recessions, hiring freezes and difficult times - when companies may not have the leeway to train you for years before you actually create value.

**During easy times people are willing to bet on your potential.
During tough times people only bet on what you can do today.**
