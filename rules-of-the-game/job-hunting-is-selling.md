**Job hunting is similar to a sales process**. Your selling your ability to create value - to companies.

### Process

You'll walk through the following steps of the job hunting process in order to 

The "Hiring process" we covered in the previous chapter is the steps a company takes to hire a candidate. This job hunting process is for you to follow to get interviews at companies.

A. **Find companies & qualify**.
Discover companies to apply to, and prioritize them such that the bulk of your effort goes towards companies that need you, and where you're a good fit.

B. **Prepare**: 
Tell a story with your pitch, resume, personal website, projects, etc. that demonstrates your ability to create value.

C. **Approach**:
There are many ways to apply to a company. Applying online and waiting to hear back from a company is the weakest way to apply to a company - especially if you don't "look good" on paper - because, as we discussed earlier, you'll be screened out by either the ATS or the recruiter before your application ends up in the hands of engineers.

The most powerful way to apply to a company is through a referral: having an engineer at the company vouch for your competence and get you the interview at the company. An engineer's recommendation is incredibly powerful and oftentimes leads directly to a phone screen, bypassing the recruiter screening altogether.

In addition to these, cold emailing, direct messaging on platforms, approaching people in-person, connecting with engineers at events, career fairs, etc. can all be powerful **channels** to reach companies. Each of these channels will help you get referrals, thereby getting you interviews.

D. **Follow-up**: 
Most approaches won't pan out immediately. Systematically, persistently, respectfully following up is the key to building connections.

E. **Phone screen**
Typically a short phone conversation that may or may not be technical (i.e. revolves around solving an engineering problem). Used to weed out incompetent candidates before the full-round of interviews that follows.

F. **Final round interviews**

G: **Offer**
Getting an offer (at a company you want to work at) is the goal state for your job hunting process.
