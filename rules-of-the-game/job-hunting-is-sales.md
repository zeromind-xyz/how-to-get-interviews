Job hunting is a sales process.
our customers are companies that need people to help them create / improve a product that they're selling to their customers.

Your product is your ability to create value for the company.

When I say "sales" you might think of the sleazy car salesperson that's relentlessly annoying in getting you to buy something you don't need. They're not great salespeople. You're never going to go back to them to buy anything else.

The best salespersons are great listeners. They start by understanding what the customer needs, then they gauge whether their product can actually help this person, and IF they believe their product can help, they work to convince the potential customer to buy the product using evidence. (TODO: need to talk about the sales channels that are used **to REACH** the customer. customers aren't just going to come to you all the time).
**--> Create a visual to express the components of the sales process and then come back here. The visualization will help you organize thinking around this.**

**Smart prioritization is the foundation of successful sales** because you don't have an infinite amount of time to spend. Oftentimes, getting an interview at a company can be a multi-week long process that can sink hours of your time. If you're not careful about which companies you put that effort towards, you'll have little to show for all your efforts.

You want to maximize your time on the companies where you have the greatest chance of getting an interview.

I recommend prioritizing companies on two factors: **urgency** (how badly they need to hire) and **fit** (how well your abilities align with what the company is looking for). 

(TODO: expand on urgency and fit right here before moving on).
**How do you know if a company has urgency?**
**How do you know if you're a good fit for a company?**

Let's understand the possible combinations and then see how to actually measure urgency and fit - in order to prioritize well.

**High urgency and high fit**. The company is growing quickly and is trying to hire engineers they needed to hire yesterday. AND you have the skills to actually create value at this company. A dream come true best case scenario.

**High fit and low urgency**. This is mostly Big Tech companies and smaller companies that aren't growing at breakneck pace. These companies don't need to hire like crazy today, but have certain hiring goals they're trying to hit. 

Hunting for companies in this section can be fruitful, but also time consuming because there's no strong incentive for the company to move fast. Like humans, companies move fast when it's  driven by the fear of survival: i.e. when an opportunity to capture a market exists, but there's a pressure to dominate the market or be left with nothing.

This is usually where you'll run into processes that take week(s) - month(s) to result in a decision (assuming you're a decent fit). You should definitely pursue these opportunities if you find companies in this quadrant that you want to work at, but temper your expectations on the speed of the process. There are ways to speed this up which we'll cover later (TODO: link to the section).

**High urgency and low fit**. This is a quadrant that most people don't see the full potential of. It's underrated, but has worked well for a few friends, and it's how I landed my first job out of college. 

The thing about companies with high urgency is that they they have a lot of shit to get done. Even if you don't fit into the mold perfectly for a given role, you have more leeway to make the argument that you can create value in a slightly different way that might lie at the intersection of multiple roles. 

In my personal case, I knew I wanted to join this particular startup and they were looking for senior Android engineers to help build the OS for a new hardware product. 

I barely knew Android development, but I knew I wanted to work with them somehow. After a conversation with the founder, I realized that in addition to building out the OS, they were also engaging with 3rd party app developers to bring them onto the platform (by getting them to launch versions of their apps that would work well on this new OS).

I felt I could do this well because it involved having the combination of technical understanding and pitching / sales. I might not have been the Android expert they were looking for, but I was able to make an argument for the combination of technical ability + sales to help drive a goal they already had.

We ended up on a trial period agreement. If I met certain goals in a month, then I'd be brought on board. Another unsual arrangement that you're unlikely to see at a larger company with more established processes, but worked well for me since I'd much rather be evaluated by actual work over solving coding puzzles that seldom align with real work.

The advantage you have when dealing with companies with urgency is that they have an actual pain that they're hiring to ease. This means that they move faster, and that they tend to be more focused on identifying people who can actually get shit done, rather than over-worry about credentials or the lack thereof. And they're more likely to be open to arrangements such as trial-before-hire, etc. 

Many companies that have high urgency also have a wildcard job listing that welcomes you to apply if you feel like you can create value but don't see a specific role listed.

Wildcard listings are becoming more popular these days because of the nature of creating value in Tech: oftentimes the greatest creators of value operate at poorly defined intersection of roles: e.g. the salesperson who can code, the designer who can code, the salesperson who loves design, the engineer who has a strong product sense.

If you have an inclination for such intersections, you might find it easier to operate at intersections at fast growing companies with a high urgency to hire.

**(TODO: really need to expand on this quadrant: this is also the quadrant for people that want to navigate into roles they have no experience for... CHAOS is the place where you can have the greatest leeway and opportunity to create cross division value).**

My **conflict** here is: for really desparate people, they need to prioritize their existing warm introductions above all else since that's their most effective channel. -> this makes sense. Actually, put this in the sourcing companies section. That's totally fine. But how does it fit into the "urgent" & "good fit" matrix? It doesn't.

The two ways to process the matrix:
- Actually, the advice is more of a heuristic. You still have the leeway to break the advice for a company you do want to work at. Quite simple. 

- Need to make the point that in this playbook, I'm trying my best not to be opinionated about which companies you're applying to. That's an important, nuanced topic worthy of another playbook altogether, beyond the scope of this one.

**A. Understand what a company wants**
* Different types of engineering (while the fundamentals of working on a map vs. a payments API do require the same fundamental software engineering principles, they are radically different expressions).
* Iterating quickly on a web app with React is a very different game than building a database and optimizing it with clever data structures & algorithms. One isn't better than the other, they require a different way of using your mind.
* By understanding which flavor of engineer this company is looking for, you can understand 1. whether you're a good fit for that role, and if so, 2. which of your past experiences you can highlight in all of your interactions with this company.
* If you have a background building web apps and a company is building a database in C++ and other low-level engineering techniques and optimizations, you're probably not going to get far with this company. Sure apply online and see what happens, but don't dedicate a lot of time trying to convince the company to interview you, it's not going to be fruitful.
* Selling a product that isn't a good fit for customer isn't going to be very fruitful. Focus energies on the opportunities that you are a good fit for.
* (Something something overestimate the average point - need to instill confidence in those that actually have the skills).
* I'm not saying don't apply to a position that asks for Python but you only know Javascript. The reality is that it's relatively easy for a person competent in one language to pick up another and  good companies understand this. But I am saying that you should avoid companies that need a very different flavor of engineering, unless you're prepared to spend time learning before you actually work there.
	* Funny story: my email interaction with George Hotz: (LOL, this is a great email interaction). https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/george+hotz/FMfcgxmRRSkQTxvhWvpXZDLNTgfjmnfk (HAHAHAHA). 
		* This is actually a perfect representation of what not to do.

**B. Gauge your ability to create value for the company**
* I believe most of you reading this are underestimating your abilities. 
* We tend to overestimate the average and underestimate the extremes. It's both true that the best engineer is 1000x more productive than the average and that the average engineer can't build a meaningful application on their own, without major bugs, in a reasonable amount of time.
* If you have baseline competence in software engineering, communication skills, the right attitude (ability to handle feedback well, always working to improve), and some common sense, you're well ahead of the pack. Of course, you'll always have a huge room for improvement and that's what you should focus on, but when it's time to job hunt, don't sell yourself short - it's not a helpful mindset.
* I wish everyone reading this gets an opportunity to process hundreds of software engineer job applications from around the world. You'll quickly realize what I mean by overestimating the mean.
* Another contributing factor is that those who are dedicated to learning will often consume content from great programmers on Youtube / TikTok / Twitch / Hackernews, etc. When you constantly consume from people who are really good (outliers), it's natural for you to feel inadequate compared to them (I definitely felt this way). Those that are actually learning a lot might be the ones most susceptible to undervaluing their skills. This is great for learning, bad for selling.
* I think it's helpful to have some cognitive dissonance: allow yourself to be humbled by the greats on a regular basis and let your "feel" for the average climb. But when it's time to job hunt, turn that system off and have a more realistic gauge of your competence. If in doubt, bias towards greater confidence.
	* More tips to increase confidence that I've found to be super helpful:
		* I've found that relentless practice is a great way to boost confidence in anything: whether it's taking the game winning shot, giving a speech in front of a large audience, and interviewing at companies.
		* I have stage fright, but I know with enough practice there comes a point when I'll be able to go out there and deliver a speech with confidence and ease.
		* Depending on your level of fear / lack of confidence, I suggest putting even more effort into the practice.
		* And you have to. Natalie Portman, Kobe Bryant, Steve Jobs all practiced for a stupid amount of time before their scenes / game-winning shots / world-class product presentations. They practiced so much that you & I felt like they were born to do this.
		* **For job hunting, there are a variety of ways you'll need to practice:**
			* Actual technical competence.
			* Your pitch
			(I want a section in which I outline some strategies that I've found incredibly useful in my life to deal with lack of confidence and fears).

**How badly a company needs to hire**
* Imagine you're trying to sell a car. One potential customer is a couple who already have a car, but are considering another car to reduce the coordination hassle in sharing a car. They can make do with what they have, but it's be kind of nice to buy another car. Another potential customer doesn't have a car and needs one to commute every day to their new job 20 miles away. Who do you think you'll have an easier time selling a car to? (Need a better, more terse example, this is way too long). (UNNECESSARY ANALOGY. Just get straight to an example with companies).
* Similarly, not all companies who list jobs have the same urgency to hire someone for a particular. One company might have a massive desire to hire because their product is growing at an alarming rate. Meanwhile another company might have an opening for a role that they don't reeallly need to fill today, but are hiring for it to meet some internal goal or because some engineering manager in the company was promised a certain team size and she's just hiring because she can.
