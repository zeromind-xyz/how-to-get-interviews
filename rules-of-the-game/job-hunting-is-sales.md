# Job hunting is sales

Job hunting is a sales process. Your customers are companies that need people to help them create / improve a product that they're selling to their customers. Your product is your ability to create value for the company.

When I say "sales" you might think of the sleazy car salesperson that's relentlessly annoying in getting you to buy something you don't need. They're not great salespeople. You're never going to go back to them to buy anything else.

The best salespersons are great listeners. They start by understanding what the customer needs, then they gauge whether their product can actually help this person, and IF they believe their product can help, they work to convince the potential customer to buy the product using evidence.
