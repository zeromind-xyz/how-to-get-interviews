# In person

"Here's what I did. I found a couple of engineering firms that I would be interested in working for and I went in for a visit, resume in hand. When I did, I didn't ask for the hiring manager, because often they would be an HR person with no background in engineering and no interest in talking to me. I would ask for one of the head engineers that would be give a me a couple minutes to tell me about the company.

Sometimes I would get to sit down right then, sometimes no one would have the time but I would schedule a sit down at a later date, sometimes they only had the time to shake my hand and say hello. In any case, I made sure that I gave them my resume and let them know that I was out of college and looking for a position. All of them told me that they didn't have anything available and probably wouldn't upon first meeting.

I gathered about 5 engineering firms that I did that with. Then, the next month or so, I would go to those same five, ask for the same person, say hello, and drop off my most up to date resume. And I would add a new firm or two each time I went out. Once a month, I would make the rounds and have a couple new meetings with a firm.

An easy way to make new contacts in other firms is to ask people that you sit down with if they know someone else that would be willing to sit down and talk to you. When you make that appointment and meet the next contact, ask them the same thing.

After a few months, most of my contacts knew me by sight and/or by name. My resume, name face were always fresh in their memory. It takes persistence but every single engineer that I talked to me said "you're going about your job search the right way. And you will find a job."

And I did. After about 6 months, I walked into a firm and my contact said "I was just thinking about you." Two weeks later I had a job." - graffsquatch (https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/23e4df/entry_level_engineers_who_are_now_hired_what_got/)
