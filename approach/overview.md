By this point you should have a well crafted resume, project, website that you can use to pitch yourself to companies.

First break down your list of companies into 3 tiers:
1. 1st tier: your dream companies. You'd be elated at the chance to work here.
2. 2nd tier: companies you respect and would be happy to work at, but aren't the ones you dream about.
3. 3rd tier: you don't want to work here, but given no other option, you may consider them.

I recommend prioritizing outreach in reverse order: starting with 3rd tier companies, and then moving to 2nd and 1st tier companies only after you're able to get a couple of interviews from the worse tier.

By starting with the companies that you aren't your top choices, you'll be able to practice your approach, how you pitch yourself, and the interviews, enabling you to succeed at the companies that matter most to you.

It's also advantageous to have an offer in hand from somewhere when interviewing at other companies. You'll have the leverage to apply pressure to speed up the process at other places because you already have an offer that is time sensitive (will expire at some point), and can use that as a pushing point: "I'd appreciate if you could get back to me within the next week because I have another offer that will expire then."

And it's a nice confidence boost to know that you're able to successfully pitch yourself.

For every phase of outreach, I recommend exhausting warm introductions (someone you know can connect you to someone at the company you're applying to, and vouch for your abilities) before moving on to cold outreach because warm introductions have a much higher success rate.

### Managing the process
- Share a Notion template that poeple can use.
- Create short Loom video showing people how to use it.
