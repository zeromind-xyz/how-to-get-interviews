"I know somebody that knows somebody that knows somebody". The world is a lot more connected than it feels.

Your network is incredibly powerful if you know how to leverage it correctly.

The first step to milking your network is to add everyone you know, that works at a Tech company, to your People tab in your spreadsheet. 

Don't leave anyone out: from school, college, life. Everyone. Even people that you lost contact with. Even people that you might have only met once playing pickup basketball 6 months ago. Go through your Emails, Instagram, Snapchat, Contacts app, etc. exhaust searching every communication channel you can think of.

It's perfectly fine if they're not an engineer, as long as they work at a Tech company, because they're in a position to be able to connect you to an engineer or hiring manager at their company.

If the person is an engineer, or engineering manager, (or CTO if the company is a smaller startup), then you will eventually want to pitch yourself to them to get an interview for an open software engineering position they have. On the other hand, if they know engineers / engineering managers, then your goal is to ask for an introduction to engineers at their company.

But you aren't ready to ask them to do anything for you just yet. Both pitching yourself to them for a job / ask for introductions are big asks. They require time and effort to process, and isn't something that will be done quickly / easily for you unless they know you.

I've found that the best first step is to engage with each person in your network in a more casual way so that you can first understand their lives, their constraints, what they're excited about, how they're doing, what work is like, how their company is, etc., and to also ask for feedback on the job hunting process in general and for job hunting tips and advice. If they're working at companies you respect, then clearly they did certain things right to earn them those positions.

### Design an in-person meeting
(This is applicable in so many chapters. I think this ought to be abstracted out into its own chapter. Seriously.)

- Pick a place close to where they are, ideally a cafe.
- Get there 5 mins before the scheduled time.
- Ask them what they want a min or so before scheduled time (so that you can buy it for them).
- Be natural: first couple of minutes are usually small talk. Keep it this way, people need time to settle down and sip their drink. Give yourself the time to settle down mentally as well. Each conversation is incredibly important. Your measure of progress in your job hunt

The goal is to show your genuine gratitude. These people are doing you a huge favor and you might not have much to give in return at the moment. You shouldn't have a sense of entitlement about the situation. 

----

* For each person, figure out the companies they work at.
- Craft a personalized message. Be genuine.
	- Have a clear ask.
	- What exactly to share and ask for.
	- Degree of formality based on closeness.
- What to talk about during the conversation
- End with clear request
- Follow-up via email right away
- Be extremely respectful of their time and effort. Always look to make it easier for them to help you.
