"I know somebody that knows somebody that knows somebody". The world is a lot more connected than it feels.

Your network is incredibly powerful if you know how to leverage it correctly.

The first step to milking your network is to add everyone you know to your People tab in your spreadsheet. Don't leave anyone out: from school, college, life. Everyone. Even people that you lost contact with. Even people that you might have only met once playing pickup basketball 6 months ago. 

Go through your Instagram, Snapchat, Contacts app, Email, etc. exhaust all of your sources for your contacts.

This is the foundation for you network. This is what you must build upon.
