"I know somebody that knows somebody that knows somebody". This is how the world works. It's a lot more connected than we feel.

- Build a list of literally everyone you know from school, college, life, etc. Everyone. Go through your Instagram, Snapchat, Contacts app, Email, etc. - and make a list of all of these people.
- Research for each person: look at their connection on Linkedin, who follows them on Twitter, who else works at their company that you'd want to get in touch with.
	- Everyone knows somebody that knows somebody. You'd be surprised how deep your network actually is once you know how to milk it.
- Craft a personalized message. Be genuine.
	- Have a clear ask.
	- What exactly to share and ask for.
	- Degree of formality based on closeness.
- What to talk about during the conversation
- End with clear request
- Follow-up via email right away
- Be extremely respectful of their time and effort. Always look to make it easier for them to help you.
