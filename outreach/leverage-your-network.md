"I know somebody that knows somebody that knows somebody". The world is a lot more connected than it feels.

Your network is incredibly powerful if you know how to leverage it correctly.

The first step to leveraging your network is to add everyone you know, that works at a Tech company, to the People tab in your spreadsheet. 

Don't leave anyone out: from school, college, life. Everyone. Even people that you lost contact with. Even people that you might have only met once playing pickup basketball 6 months ago. Go through your Emails, Instagram, Snapchat, Contacts app, etc. exhaust searching every communication channel you can think of.

It's perfectly fine if they're not an engineer, as long as they work at a Tech company, because they're in a position to be able to connect you to an engineer or hiring manager at their company.

For each person, there are 2 possible outcomes to work towards:
1. Pitch yourself to get an internal referral at their company.
2. Get introduced to at least 2 of their engineer friends.

If the person is an engineer, or engineering manager, (or CTO if the company is a smaller startup), then you can pursue both outcomes. If they're not engineers themselves (/ don't have influence over engineering hiring), then you'd want to pursue only the second outcome: get introduced to their engineer friends.

But, unless you know them really well, and have been in touch on a regular basis, and know for a fact that they are willing to introduce you to someone / willing to give you an internal referral - you're not ready to ask for anything. Pitching for an internal referral and asking for introductions are HUGE asks. You need to first warm up your relationship with them.

I've found that the best first step is to establish an **emotional connection** with those in your network. I define an emotional connection as that mutual feeling of wanting to see the other person do well and be happy. The magnitude of the connection is proportional to the depth of that feeling.

Think about your relationship with your close friends and family where you have a mutual desire to see each other do well in life and be happy. You have a strong emotional connection with them. That's the kind of feeling you want to work towards for those in your network. Not only does this lead to a more powerful network where you can help and ask for help, you'll also be much happier having a network of people you want to see do well, and feel their warmth as well.

On the other end of the spectrum are purely transactional relationships: you know that one person in your life always seems to remember you only when they need something? Having some transactional relationships is unavoidable, but I think it's a big mistake to design all of your relationships this way.

Working towards a strong emotional connection (like you have with close friends and family) is also likely not feasible, because that takes a lot of time and alignment, but it is possible to create a baseline emotional connection quickly: over the course of a single meeting.

In my experience, the best way to establish this connection is to:

**Follow the energy**
Find the shared passions and dig deep into it. These passions are anything that arouse emotion: e.g. hatred towards the mainstream interview process of solving coding puzzles to get jobs, or excitment for a new book that's coming out, or sadness over the impact of a pandemic.

We all have topics that make us feel. In a conversation when you find a certain topic is something they feel strongly about, lean into it.

Of course, it's still necessary to prepare for a "warm-up" meeting, but any agenda / talking points you have are merely suggestions and nudges to find the shared passions to dig deep into

**Understand their life**
Have a sense for what's at the top of their mind these days. This could be a desire to move out of their current city, company, etc. Ask why and understand their core motivations for what they're trying to do. For example, more important than knowing that they work at a specific company is to understand why they chose to work there, what drew them in, and how they find their work meaningful.

This kind of context is important to be able to offer any help. You might be too early in your career to be able to offer them any kind of career help, but you can definitely help them pack their belongings for a move. But how would you even know you can offer that help if you don't understand their lives at least a little bit.

### Asking for a warm-up meeting

Hey Alice,

(tailored opening) Congrats on your launch on Product Hunt last week! I saw it and was reminded of our conversation last year at Liz's party where you told me about this idea. I'm currently on the waitlist & hoping to try it out soon :).

(ask) I'm currently job hunting for a software engineering role at startups and would greatly appreciate a chance to learn from you about job hunting, becoming a better engineer and absorb any advice you may have on building a career in Tech in general.

(specific meeting proposal) Would you have time for a 20 minute coffee right next to your office (or anywhere that's convenient for you), this Saturday? Say, at 4pm?

Regards,
Karthik

**Tailored opening**
If this is someone you've met before / chatted with before, bring up something relevant to show that you've taken the effort to look up what they've been up to. Given how public information is these days, you should at least know where someone works and ideally what they're working on as well.

**Ask**
Propose what you want: an opportunity to absorb their advice on job hunting / some other generally broad discussion area that still leaves room for a broader conversation. So rather than a specific question that can be answered in 5 minutes, ask something more along the lines of "career advice", etc.

I believe it's incredibly important to be transparent about your ask. If you reach out asking to talk about some other topic (say some project), but in the middle of the conversation talk about how you're job hunting and nudge the conversation towards job hunting, it discredits your interest in that other topic. (TODO: need to think about this more... there's definitely a better way of phrasing this).

The better approach is to start by sharing that you're job hunting, so that you put it out there and the recipient knows that's the top issue on your mind. It doesn't matter if you barely talk about it during the conversation, but at least they know.

**Meeting proposal**
It helps to propose a specific time and place because it reduces the decision making burden on 
them. But don't come off as dictating the time and place. This is a proposal to make it easy for them, not to make it easy for you.

Make sure to specify the duration and keep your ask to under 30 minutes. Personally I prefer asking for 20 minutes: it feel short enough to say yes to quickly. 30 minutes is on the edge of what is a "short" meeting, and will require more thought on their end.

I also prefer to ask for meetings on the weekends because people are less likely to have to get back to work right after the meeting. This means that if it goes well, they're more likely to be able to extend it.

Pick a place close to where they are, ideally a cafe. A walk & talk is the next best thing (if weather permits). Avoid proposing dinner / lunch unless you know them well enough: it feels like a larger commitment that they can't bounce from if the conversation isn't going well. Coffee catch-ups feel like a much smaller commitment that they can leave early if they don't feel like it's working out for some reason - making it easier for them to say yes to.

Meeting in person is significantly better than via a call. Humans are simply designed to connect better in person. A video call is the next best option if for some reason in-person is off the table. I find phone calls to be significantly worse than video calls because we lose the visual aspect of human connection completely - which has been shown to be important to build stronger relationships.

When describing the place & time, I'd recommend adding phrases like "(or wherever is convenient for you)", and blunting the ask a bit with "Say, at 4pm" to make it sound that your proposal isn't fixed in stone: that it can be modified and that you're open to adjusting for their convenience, rather than the other way around.

**Link to your website**
At the very bottom of your signature, make sure to link to your [[website]] that pitches your work effectively. This is especially important if you don't know this person too well & they're really busy. Busy people will want to restrict their time to the most promising people, and will probably look at your website to determine whether you've put in the work and are promising.

### Preparation
Before you meet them, it helps to have a sense for what they're interested in.
Go through any essays, videos, LinkedIn posts, etc. that they may have published. Look up the company they work at. If they're an engineer, read up on their company's engineering blog. Understand their product. 

Having context and information will make it easier for you to push the conversation in the direction that the person's actually interested in.

Write down a few questions that will help you understand them better. I like to write these questions down beforehand and internalize them BEFORE I actually meet them. I do this because I find that having more time, and no pressure, to formulate my questions leads me to having better questions.

Some questions I love to ask (of course tailor to their particular situation):
- What's at the top of your mind these days?
- What led you to joining your Acme (insert their company)? How did you decide where to work?

### Get there early

If your meeting is in-person and at a cafe, make sure to get there 10 minutes early. This gives you time to get settled into the environment and be there to receive the person you're meeting.

2 minutes before the scheduled meeting time, send them a message: "Hey, is there anything you'd like to drink? I can order now since I'm in line.". You want to be the one buying the coffee / whatever they want. 

This gesture is important because it implicitly signals that you greatly appreciate their time and are thanking them for their time. You can't have a trace of entitlement during this process. These are people that you want to genuinely connect with and have their support as you progress in your career and life. No one wants to support someone that feels entitled to support. 

Showing gratitude with actions is more powerful than simply saying "I'm so grateful that you were able to spend time earlier today". Getting there early, holding down a table, buying them coffee and setting it on the table perfectly waiting for them as they arrive is a gesture that demonstrates your gratitude, and will be received well.

If the meeting is a video call, join the meeting 5 minutes in advance and greet them with a warm smile :). Always be there early. From their perspective: joining a call to help someone only to be the first one in the call is annoying.

### Conversation

This is how many of my warm-up meetings go. This might not be how yours goes, but the goal isn't to follow some pre-determined path, but rather to find the method that works for you to build that foundational emotional connection.

I will usually start with small talk: "How was your day?" - just something easy to help us both settle in.

Some folks aren't a fan of small talk and you can tell by the way they answer that question: they'll give a short, quick answer and feel ready to pounce on the conversation that actually matters. Others actually do need the time to settle. 

When it feels natural to move on, usually in a minute or two, I'll re-iterate what I emailed them about (to ask them for this meeting), but nudge it in the direction that I think is where the excitement lies: 

"As I mentiond, I'm actively looking for software engineering roles right now. Thanks for taking the time to chat with me, I know I have a lot to learn from you. But before jumping into that I'd love to learn more about your work at Acme: I saw your tweet about the new app you just launched to early users, how's that going?".

Since you're the one asking for the meeting, it's your responsibility to set the initial direction. Here, I usually re-iterate the ask that I reached out to them in the first place "advice on building a career in Tech", but then jump into the question I'm more interested in which is about what they're working on.

And that's it. Once someone starts talking about what's exciting to them, if it's exciting for you as well, then just let it flow.

With many conversations, you'll begin to develop a feel for how to nudge conversations in ways that energize both of you.

I've found that even topics that I thought were boring, when described by someone passionate about it, becomes exciting. So by simply nudging someone to talking about what they find exciting, will likely energize you as well.

Eventually, because you set the context at the beginning, they'll usually bring the conversation back to the job hunting. But it's perfectly fine if they don't. 

In fact, in the best warm-up meeting I had we didn't even have time to talk about job hunting because we went deep into some project they were working on for hours: turning a coffee meeting into a lunch and long walk.

But if it does come back to job hunting, I usually throw a general question to them that gives them space to choose the most interesting thing to tell you. Something along the lines of "If you could give the new grad you advice on job hunting / thinking about how to build your career, what would you tell them?". 

I love these kinds of questions because people are a lot more hestitant to give others their strong opinions on job hunting because they don't fully know the other person's context and constraints, but when asked to give advice to their former self, they can be very opinionated, and rightly so since they have full context.

And it's these unfiltered, strongly opinionated advice to former selves that I think is actually most valuable as well because our situations are actually far more similar than we seem to believe.

Lastly, they might push the conversation to what you've done in the past, at which point be prepared to go into your most impressive experience / project. Treat this like an interview because it is! If you can demonstrate that you have competence and are promising, this person is far more likely to be able to help you by offering to introduce you to friends, or offer a referral at their company.

Don't explain your project in fancy, impressive sounding words. Just say it as it is: in simple words that makes it clear what your project is. Be ready to answer any questions (see: [[projects]]) they have about your project.

You likely won't have any time beyond this.

If things went well, they'll be the ones to bring up ways in which they can help you, or in some cases, they'll ask you how they can help. If they realized they're running late and had to bounce quickly, you might not even reach this stage in the conversation, which is totally fine because you'll be following up later anyways.

But if they do ask you what you're looking for, have an ask ready: **"Would you be able to connect me to any engineer friends so that I can pick their brains as well?"**. They'll almost definitely say yes. 

By this point if they're able to offer you a referral, they'll offer it. If they don't offer it, then they're not able to, and there's no point pushing for it. If you push for a referral, even if they say they will refer you out of the awkwardness of deying your request, it won't be a strong referral anyways, and you'll likely hurt your relationship with this person.

Shake their hand. Thank them for their time.

### Follow-up

Hey Alice,

It was great catching up earlier.

(proposing introduction process) Thanks for offering to introduce me to your friends. When you can, could you share the profiles of the friend you can introduce me to? I'll craft an email tailored to each and send to you, which you can easily forward to each to see if they're interested.

(emphasize their control) Let me know if you'd prefer another approach / if there's anything else I can do to make this easy for you.

(link to your project) <>: this is the app that I built that lets you annotate articles you read on the internet. Hope you're able to try it out! Would greatly appreciate any feedback.

(references from conversation) Also, this is is the article I referred to in our conversation about desigining decentralized social platforms: <>.

Thanks,
Karthik

**Proposing introduction process**
When someone agrees to introduce you to their friends, and hasn't yet given specific names of the people they're willing to introduce you to (perhaps because they still need to think about it), you can gently remind them to send you their profiles.

Having profiles of the people you'll be introduced to is important: it's the first step to kickstarting the introduction process (TODO: link chapter). It enables you to craft a tailored message to that person so that they're more likely to, and more excited to, respond to the request for an introduction.

**Emphasize their control** 
You're proposing things to make it easier for them, not to assert some kind of control over the process. They are the ones that have full power over how they want to help you (obviously). By emphasizing their control, you re-iterate this feeling that you're willing to do whatever's necessary to make it easy for them to help you.

**Link to your project**
If you had a chance to talk about your project / most impressive past experience, make sure to link it in this follow-up email. Make it easy for them to try it out and play with it.

**References from conversation**
If there were any follow-ups from the conversation: e.g. you referenced an article / book / film / video, etc., it would be nice to include that here.

### Gently nudge if they forget

It's common for people to take a while to respond at times because of how busy they are. 

Give people at least a week to respond, and then send them a gentle reminder.

For example, if they don't reply to the follow-up email, you can send: "Hey Alice, hope you're doing well. I know you're really busy, but just wanted to gently remind you about the profiles of friends you can introduce me to. I'll send you tailored emails you can forward to them in one click. Thanks!"

Make sure to be respectful of their time, and use a tone that makes it clear that you're doing your best to minimize effort on their end. You aren't entitled to anything, and they're doing you a huge favor by making these introductions.

### Build long-term relationships

I recommend following up with everyone you've had a warm-up meeting with once every two weeks to keep them posted on your progress whether it's interview prep, finding companies, or anything related to your job hunt.

By taking people with you on your journey, you keep your relationship with them warm. The next time you meet them / chat with them, they'll likely have a lot more context about what you've been up to.

Also, by showing the effort you're putting into your job hunt, you make people want to help you out. People have an innate desire to help those that are diligently working towards something. It's human nature. By showing the effort you're putting in on a regular basis, you'll attract greater support.

Here's a simple "update" template you can use to send your network.

----

Subject: (your_name) Update

Hey Alice,

Hope you're well, here's a quick update of what I've been up to over the past couple of weeks:

Job hunting:
- Had my first technical interview at Disney!
- Had conversations with engineers at Acme, and Bacme.
- Cold emailed engineers and managers from 15 companies and heard back positively from 2, looking to hop on a call with them this upcoming week.

I finally made time to update the landing page for my app: <>. I improved the marketing copy, and gained 5 new users.

Lastly, I'd greatly appreciate introductions to folks at tech companies that you think I'd be a good fit at. And please do send any essays / books / videos you think would help me.

Thanks,
Karthik

p.s. Best thing I read recently: <>.

----

I'd recommend 3 sections to your update:
1. Job hunting (offer > interviews > conversations > cold outreach responses > number of people you reached out to).
2. Project updates (any updates you've made to your project. Any new outcomes? e.g. new users, or perhaps you got some good feedback from a user and will implement it after job hunting, etc.).
3. Asks (usually for more introductions).
4. Random cool things you came across (in postscript - after your signature).

I'd recommend sticking to your update schedule consistently unless you absolutely have nothing to show for that 2 week period (which honestly should never be the case). But if you have nothing to show, don't send an update.
