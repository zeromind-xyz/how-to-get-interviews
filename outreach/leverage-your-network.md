"I know somebody that knows somebody that knows somebody". The world is a lot more connected than it feels.

Your network is incredibly powerful if you know how to leverage it correctly.

Leveraging your network is the process of __.

The first step to leveraging your network is to add everyone you know, that works at a Tech company, to the People tab in your spreadsheet. 

Don't leave anyone out: from school, college, life. Everyone. Even people that you lost contact with. Even people that you might have only met once playing pickup basketball 6 months ago. Go through your Emails, Instagram, Snapchat, Contacts app, etc. exhaust searching every communication channel you can think of.

It's perfectly fine if they're not an engineer, as long as they work at a Tech company, because they're in a position to be able to connect you to an engineer or hiring manager at their company.

For each person, there are 2 possible outcomes to work towards:
1. Pitch yourself to get an internal referral at their company.
2. Get introduced to at least 2 of their engineer friends.

If the person is an engineer, or engineering manager, (or CTO if the company is a smaller startup), then you can pursue both outcomes. If they're not engineers themselves (/ don't have influence over engineering hiring), then you'd want to pursue only the second outcome: get introduced to their engineer friends.

Unless you already know them really well, and have been in touch on a regular basis, and know for a fact that they are willing to introduce you to someone / willing to give you an internal referral - you're not ready to push directly for the outcomes above. Pitching for an internal referral and asking for introductions are HUGE asks. They take time and effort on their end, and are best asked after warming up your relationship. (TODO: rephrase the crap out of this, sounds wayyy too formal).

I've found that the best first step is to engage with each person in your network in a more casual way so that you can first understand their lives, their constraints, what they're excited about, how they're doing, what work is like, how their company is, etc., and to also ask for feedback on the job hunting process in general and for job hunting tips and advice. If they're working at companies you respect, then clearly they did certain things right to earn them those positions, which you can learn from. 

I call this a "warm-up" meeting: a meeting with a less direct agenda with room for casual conversation to understand each other. This is a critical step that establishes your relationships and enables you to gain supporters: people that want to see you succeed and are willing to help you in that cause.

Having supporters is critical. If you don't first establish a relationship with someone and directly ask them for specific help (e.g. introductions / internal referral), then your relationship remains transactional. Transactional is the only path when there's no opportunity for a deeper relationship (e.g. when the person you want to connect with is way too busy), but if possible you should try to build a meaningful relationship.

By "establish relationship", I don't mean wait weeks chatting with someone before you ask them for specific help, but to at least have a baseline understanding of this person, what they're going through in life, what they're excited about, etc. before pitching yourself or asking for introductions.

When I first moved to San Francisco right after dropping out of college, looking to join an exciting startup, I was shocked, surprised and deeply moved by how complete strangers were willing to listen to my weird ideas, offer their feedback and extend help. I felt I didn't deserve it, and I didn't even understand why they'd take time out of their busy lives to help me with anything. Therefore I'd feel nervous to even ask for help.

As I gained experience and found myself able to offer feedback & advice to others, I learned that supporting others and being able to help others on their paths is a deeply fulfilling and satisfying experience. If I had experientially understood the benefits of supporting others sooner in my career, I would have asked a lot more people for feedback and help, knowing that I wasn't weighing them down.

And that's what I hope you're able to do. Asking others for feedback, advice, help on something you're working to achieve is usually a fulfiling experience for both parties. Some of my closest relationships in life started off as me asking for feedback on something I was working on. If you're feeling nervous about reaching out to everyone you know for advice and help, keep this principle in mind and try to feel more at peace with it.

Sooner or later, you'll be able to offer help in return, and I hope as you build your fulfilling career, you too will find the joy in helping those that are earlier than you in their careers.

### Asking for a warm-up meeting

Hey Alice,

(tailored opening) Congrats on your launch on Product Hunt last week! I saw it and was reminded of our conversation last year at Liz's party where you told me about this idea. I'm currently on the waitlist & hoping to try it out soon :).

(ask) I'm currently job hunting for a software engineering role at startups and would greatly appreciate a chance to learn from you about job hunting, becoming a better engineer and absorb any advice you may have on building a career in Tech in general.

(specific meeting proposal) Would you have time for a coffee right next to your office (or anywhere that's convenient for you), this Friday? Say, at 4pm? 

Regards,
Karthik

**Tailored opening**
If this is someone you've met before / chatted with before, bring up something relevant to show that you've taken the effort to look up what they've been up to. Given how public information is these days, you should at least know where someone works and ideally what they're working on as well.

**Ask**
This is where you propose what you'd appreciate from them: an opportunity to absorb their advice on job hunting / some other generally broad discussion area that leaves room for a longer conversation and doesn't feel like restricted, specific agenda.

**Meeting proposal**
It helps to propose a specific time and place because it reduces the decision making burden on 
them. But you have to be careful not to come off as dictating the time and place. This is a proposal to make it easy for them, not to make it easy for you.

Pick a place close to where they are, ideally a cafe. A walk & talk is the next best thing (if weather permits). Avoid proposing dinner / lunch unless you know them well enough: it feels like a larger commitment that they can't bounce from if the conversation isn't going well. Coffee catch-ups feel like a much smaller commitment that they can leave early if they don't feel like it's working out for some reason - making it easier for them to say yes to.

Meeting in person is significantly better than via a call. Humans are simply designed to connect better in person. A video call is the next best option if for some reason in-person is off the table. I find phone calls to be significantly worse than video calls because we lose the visual aspect of human connection completely - which has been shown to be important to build stronger relationships.

When describing the place & time, I'd recommend adding phrases like "(or wherever is convenient for you)", and blunting the ask a bit with "Say, at 4pm" to make it sound that your proposal isn't fixed in stone: that it can be modified and that you're open to adjusting for their convenience, rather than the other way around.

**Link to your website**
At the very bottom of your signature, make sure to link to your [[website]] that pitches your work effectively. This is especially important if you don't know this person too well & they're really busy. Busy people will want to restrict their time to the most promising people, and will probably look at your website to determine whether you've put in the work and are promising.

### Preparation
Before you meet them, it helps to have a sense for what they're interested in.
Go through any essays, videos, LinkedIn posts, etc. that they may have published. Look up the company they work at. If they're an engineer, read up on their company's engineering blog. Understand their product. 

Having context and information will make it easier for you to push the conversation in the direction that the person's actually interested in.

Write down a few questions that will help you understand them better. I like to write these questions down beforehand and internalize them BEFORE I actually meet them. I do this because I find that having more time, and no pressure, to formulate my questions leads me to having better questions.

Some questions I love to ask (of course tailor to their particular situation):
- What's at the top of your mind these days?
- What led you to joining your Acme (insert their company)? How did you decide where to work?

### How to run a warm-up meeting

**Logistics**
If your meeting is in-person and at a cafe, make sure to get there 10 minutes early. This gives you time to get settled into the environment and be there to receive the person you're meeting.

2 minutes before the scheduled meeting time, send them a message: "Hey, is there anything you'd like to drink? I can order now since I'm in line.". You want to be the one buying the coffee / whatever they want. 

This gesture is important because it implicitly signals that you greatly appreciate their time and are thanking them for their time. You can't have a trace of entitlement during this process. These are people that you want to genuinely connect with and have their support as you progress in your career and life. No one wants to support someone that feels entitled to support. 

Showing gratitude with actions is more powerful than simply saying "I'm so grateful that you were able to spend time earlier today" later in the day. Getting there early, holding down a table, buying them coffee and setting it on the table perfectly waiting for them as they arrive is a gesture that will be received well.

If the meeting is a video call, join the meeting 5 minutes in advance and greet them with a warm smile :). Always be there early. From their perspective: joining a call to help someone out only to see that you're the first person is annoying.

**The conversation**
Start with some small talk. This gives you both time to settle. 

Then, based on your research, nudge the conversation towards what they do, how work is, what they're excited about, etc. Your goal is to get to the topic that's most exciting for them, not necessarily what you want to talk about. In fact, if the conversation is going well, completely abandon nudging it any pre-meditated direction. 

Bu if it feels natural, also ask questions about their job hunting process: i.e. how they went about it, what they wish they'd done differently, etc. 

### What NOT to do

### Follow-up

### Keep them posted
- etc. and to have them on your job hunting journey by keeping them updated on your progress (e.g. landing interviews, getting offers, etc.).
