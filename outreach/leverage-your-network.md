"I know somebody that knows somebody that knows somebody". The world is a lot more connected than it feels.

Your network is incredibly powerful if you know how to leverage it correctly.

The first step to leveraging your network is to add everyone you know, that works at a Tech company, to the People tab in your spreadsheet. 

Don't leave anyone out: from school, college, life. Everyone. Even people that you lost contact with. Even people that you might have only met once playing pickup basketball 6 months ago. Go through your Emails, Instagram, Snapchat, Contacts app, etc. exhaust searching every communication channel you can think of.

It's perfectly fine if they're not an engineer, as long as they work at a Tech company, because they're in a position to be able to connect you to an engineer or hiring manager at their company.

For each person, there are 2 possible outcomes to work towards:
1. Pitch yourself to get an internal referral at their company.
2. Get introduced to at least 2 of their engineer friends.

If the person is an engineer, or engineering manager, (or CTO if the company is a smaller startup), then you can pursue both outcomes. If they're not engineers themselves (/ don't have influence over engineering hiring), then you'd want to pursue only the second outcome: get introduced to their engineer friends.

But, unless you know them really well, and have been in touch on a regular basis, and know for a fact that they are willing to introduce you to someone / willing to give you an internal referral - you're not ready to ask for anything. Pitching for an internal referral and asking for introductions are HUGE asks. You need to first warm up your relationship with them.

I've found that the best first step is to establish an **emotional connection** with those in your network. I define an emotional connection as that mutual feeling of wanting to see the other person do well and be happy. The magnitude of the connection is proportional to the depth of that feeling.

Think about your relationship with your close friends and family where you have a mutual desire to see each other do well in life and be happy. You have a strong emotional connection with them. That's the kind of feeling you want to work towards for those in your network. Not only does this lead to a more powerful network where you can help and ask for help, you'll also be much happier having a network of people you want to see do well, and feel their warmth as well.

On the other end of the spectrum are purely transactional relationships: you know that one person in your life always seems to remember you only when they need something? Having some transactional relationships is unavoidable, but I think it's a big mistake to design all of your relationships this way.

Working towards a strong emotional connection (like you have with close friends and family) is also likely not feasible, because that takes a lot of time and alignment, but it is possible to create a baseline emotional connection quickly: over the course of a single meeting.

In my experience, the best way to establish this connection is to:

**Follow the energy**
Find the shared passions and dig deep into it. These passions are anything that arouse emotion: e.g. hatred towards the mainstream interview process of solving coding puzzles to get jobs, or excitment for a new book that's coming out, or sadness over the impact of a pandemic.

We all have topics that make us feel. In a conversation when you find a certain topic is something they feel strongly about, lean into it.

Of course, it's still necessary to prepare for a "warm-up" meeting, but any agenda / talking points you have are merely suggestions and nudges to find the shared passions to dig deep into

**Understand their life**
Have a sense for what's at the top of their mind these days. This could be a desire to move out of their current city, company, etc. Ask why and understand their core motivations for what they're trying to do. For example, more important than knowing that they work at a specific company is to understand why they chose to work there, what drew them in, and how they find their work meaningful.

This kind of context is important to be able to offer any help. You might be too early in your career to be able to offer them any kind of career help, but you can definitely help them pack their belongings for a move. But how would you even know you can offer that help if you don't understand their lives at least a little bit.

### Asking for a warm-up meeting

Hey Alice,

(tailored opening) Congrats on your launch on Product Hunt last week! I saw it and was reminded of our conversation last year at Liz's party where you told me about this idea. I'm currently on the waitlist & hoping to try it out soon :).

(ask) I'm currently job hunting for a software engineering role at startups and would greatly appreciate a chance to learn from you about job hunting, becoming a better engineer and absorb any advice you may have on building a career in Tech in general.

(specific meeting proposal) Would you have time for a coffee right next to your office (or anywhere that's convenient for you), this Friday? Say, at 4pm? 

Regards,
Karthik

**Tailored opening**
If this is someone you've met before / chatted with before, bring up something relevant to show that you've taken the effort to look up what they've been up to. Given how public information is these days, you should at least know where someone works and ideally what they're working on as well.

**Ask**
This is where you propose what you'd appreciate from them: an opportunity to absorb their advice on job hunting / some other generally broad discussion area that leaves room for a longer conversation and doesn't feel like restricted, specific agenda.

**Meeting proposal**
It helps to propose a specific time and place because it reduces the decision making burden on 
them. But you have to be careful not to come off as dictating the time and place. This is a proposal to make it easy for them, not to make it easy for you.

Pick a place close to where they are, ideally a cafe. A walk & talk is the next best thing (if weather permits). Avoid proposing dinner / lunch unless you know them well enough: it feels like a larger commitment that they can't bounce from if the conversation isn't going well. Coffee catch-ups feel like a much smaller commitment that they can leave early if they don't feel like it's working out for some reason - making it easier for them to say yes to.

Meeting in person is significantly better than via a call. Humans are simply designed to connect better in person. A video call is the next best option if for some reason in-person is off the table. I find phone calls to be significantly worse than video calls because we lose the visual aspect of human connection completely - which has been shown to be important to build stronger relationships.

When describing the place & time, I'd recommend adding phrases like "(or wherever is convenient for you)", and blunting the ask a bit with "Say, at 4pm" to make it sound that your proposal isn't fixed in stone: that it can be modified and that you're open to adjusting for their convenience, rather than the other way around.

**Link to your website**
At the very bottom of your signature, make sure to link to your [[website]] that pitches your work effectively. This is especially important if you don't know this person too well & they're really busy. Busy people will want to restrict their time to the most promising people, and will probably look at your website to determine whether you've put in the work and are promising.

### Preparation
Before you meet them, it helps to have a sense for what they're interested in.
Go through any essays, videos, LinkedIn posts, etc. that they may have published. Look up the company they work at. If they're an engineer, read up on their company's engineering blog. Understand their product. 

Having context and information will make it easier for you to push the conversation in the direction that the person's actually interested in.

Write down a few questions that will help you understand them better. I like to write these questions down beforehand and internalize them BEFORE I actually meet them. I do this because I find that having more time, and no pressure, to formulate my questions leads me to having better questions.

Some questions I love to ask (of course tailor to their particular situation):
- What's at the top of your mind these days?
- What led you to joining your Acme (insert their company)? How did you decide where to work?

### Logistics
If your meeting is in-person and at a cafe, make sure to get there 10 minutes early. This gives you time to get settled into the environment and be there to receive the person you're meeting.

2 minutes before the scheduled meeting time, send them a message: "Hey, is there anything you'd like to drink? I can order now since I'm in line.". You want to be the one buying the coffee / whatever they want. 

This gesture is important because it implicitly signals that you greatly appreciate their time and are thanking them for their time. You can't have a trace of entitlement during this process. These are people that you want to genuinely connect with and have their support as you progress in your career and life. No one wants to support someone that feels entitled to support. 

Showing gratitude with actions is more powerful than simply saying "I'm so grateful that you were able to spend time earlier today". Getting there early, holding down a table, buying them coffee and setting it on the table perfectly waiting for them as they arrive is a gesture that demonstrates your gratitude, and will be received well.

If the meeting is a video call, join the meeting 5 minutes in advance and greet them with a warm smile :). Always be there early. From their perspective: joining a call to help someone only to be the first one in the call is annoying.

### Conversation
- Aim is to create an emotional connection.
- Follow the excitement.
- Present, and let them choose.
- Read their body language and make adjustments accordingly.


### What NOT to do
- Just

### Follow-up

### Keep them posted
- etc. and to have them on your job hunting journey by keeping them updated on your progress (e.g. landing interviews, getting offers, etc.).
