Alice wants to connect with Maya, and has a mutual friend Jane. So Alice asks Jane if she can introduce her to Maya. Jane obliges and "introduces" Alice to Maya via email.

The introduction is the process of a person (Jane) introducing two people they know (Alice, Maya) who haven't met each other.

Alice is the person **requesting an introduction**.
Maya **being introduced to** Alice.
Jane is the person **introducing**.

The introduction is the most effective way to meet new people and grow your network. When you meet a new person through a mutual connection, there's a much higher baseline trust and connection they have going into the conversation because of your association with someone they trust. It'll serve you well to become good at requesting and running an introduction process.

Always remember that the person making the introduction (Jane in the example above) is the one facing the consequences in case the meeting doesn't go well. If, for some reason, Alice (requestor) is rude to Maya / wastes Maya's time, or in any way makes Maya regret accepting the introduction, Maya will value Jane's word less.

Alice doesn't suffer much because she doesn't even have a relationship with Maya yet. But Jane's relationship with Maya will suffer because she is the one who nudged Maya to give time to Alice.

And since Alice made Jane face the consequences of a bad meeting, Jane is now less likely to introduce Alice to anyone else, locking Alice out of Jane's network.

Since there's such a high potential downside to having a bad meeting, you have to be extra careful when handling a meeting that you gain through an introduction because you won't be the only person that suffers if you handle it poorly.

### Overview

1. Know who you're going to be introduced to.
2. Research the person and have a clear ask that is tailored to their background.
3. Craft an email to send to the person making the introduction, addressed to the person you want to connect with.
4. The person making the introduction will forward your email to the person you want to connect with. If that person agrees to the introduction, you'll be CC'd by the person making the introduction to the same email thread.
5. Move the introducer to BCC and announce that you did so while thanking them. Thank the new connection for making the time to chat with you. Propose the next step (it is your responsibility).

This is the general flow of an email introduction.

The first step is obvious: you must know WHO you're going to be introduced to. Don't make the mistake of just sending a paragraph about yourself to somoene in your network asking them to just forward it to people they know. You're likely not going to hear back from that approach. You have to know who you're being introduced to so that you can tailor you ask to them specifically.

Not only is this advantageous because you can ask for the right things, but you also show that you actually care about meeting them, which goes a long way when starting a new relationship with someone.

Once you know who you're being introduced to, it's time to learn about them. What are they excited about? What's their background? Where have they worked? You will use this information when crafting an email to them.

### The email

----

Subject: REQUEST: intro Maya <> Alice.

Hey Jane, Ccould you introduce me to Maya? You can simply CC them, thanks!

Hey Maya,

I'd greatly appreciate a chance to chat with you about building a career in Tech. 

I'm currently job hunting for a software engineer position. I'm debating between joining a startup or going the big company route. I'd love for a chance to understand your experiences at Snapchat, Instagram and SpaceX to help me better understand the trade-offs in choosing where to work.

Would a quick 20 min coffee work for you this Friday afternoon at your office at, say, 3pm? Can also do a phone call / anything you'd prefer.

About me:
- Excited to join a fast moving company as a full-stack software engineer. I have a background in  web and mobile engineering.
- Built a note-taking app that has dozens of active users: <>.
- Recent grad from Internet University.

Regards,
Alice

If the email is successful, Jane will CC Maya to this thread, and Maya will respond with something along the lines of:

----
Thanks for connecting us Jane, hope your product launch is going well :).

Hey Alice, great to meet! I'd love to chat. Friday is tough, could you pick a time on my Calendly: <>. 

At my office works well. Looking forward to chatting!

-- Maya

----

To which you would respond: 

----
Thanks for the intro Jane (moved to BCC).

Thanks Maya. I sent an invite through Calendly. Looking forward to meeting you this Thursday at 9am.

-- Alice

If Jane CC's Maya, but Maya doesn't repond, then wait a week or so and gently follow up: "Hey Maya, I'm sure you're really busy. Just checking to see if you'd be able to spare a little bit of time in the coming weeks, would really appreciate it!"

### Follow-up

After connecting with the person you've been introduced to, make sure to follow up and thank the person who made that introduction. It's important to follow-up to tell them how well your meeting went, and to thank them. The person who made the introduction has their reputation on the line and will want to know how well it went.

When both parties (requestor and the person introduced to) express their gratitude to the person who made the introduction, they'll know it went well, will be happy and will be more likely to make more introductions to the person who asked for the introduction.
