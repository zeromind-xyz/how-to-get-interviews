Alice wants to connect with Maya, and has a mutual friend Jane. So Alice asks Jane if she can introduce her to Maya. Jane obliges and "introduces" Alice to Maya via email.

The introduction is the process of a person (Jane) introducing two people they know (Alice, Maya) who haven't met each other.

Alice is the person **requesting an introduction**.
Maya **being introduced to** Alice.
Jane is the person **introducing**.

The introduction is the most effective way to meet new people and grow your network. When you meet a new person through a mutual connection, there's a much higher baseline trust and connection they have going into the conversation because of your association with someone they trust. It'll serve you well to become good at requesting and running an introduction process.

Always remember that the person making the introduction (Jane in the example above) is the one facing the consequences in case the meeting doesn't go well. If, for some reason, Alice (requestor) is rude to Maya / wastes Maya's time, or in any way makes Maya regret accepting the introduction, Maya will value Jane's word less.

Alice doesn't suffer much because she doesn't even have a relationship with Maya yet. But Jane's relationship with Maya will suffer because she is the one who nudged Maya to give time to Alice.

And since Alice made Jane face the consequences of a bad meeting, Jane is now less likely to introduce Alice to anyone else, locking Alice out of Jane's network.

Since there's such a high potential downside to having a bad meeting, you have to be extra careful when handling a meeting that you gain through an introduction because you won't be the only person that suffers if you handle it poorly.
