- What is this.
- How to ask for an introduction
- Research (understand the background of the person you're being connected to)
- Make it easy to help you (minimize effort for the person making the introduction)

Alice wants to connect with Maya, and has a mutual friend Jane. So Alice asks Jane if she can introduce her to Maya. Jane obliges and "introduces" Alice to Maya via email.

The introduction is the process of a person (Jane) introducing two people they know (Alice, Maya) who haven't met each other.

It's one of the most important processes you'll use to grow your network because when you meet a new person through a mutual connection, there's a much higher baseline trust and connection they have going into the conversation through your association with someone they trust.
