# Cold message

- Overview: build list, tailor message, send message, follow-up, tips & tricks.
- List building
	- How to choose the right people at a company to reach out to
	- How many to reach out to?
- Message
	- Subject line
	- Tailoring to recipient, to position, to company.
	- Body
	- Signature
- Follow-up (once per week, unless they're not even opening it)
- Tips
	- Track open rate (use to optimize messaging). Iteration matters!
	- Track open -> response time / # opens -> response time. This should ideally be short (how long when you have to start worrying about optimizing this?)
- The importance of personalization vs. cookie-cutter email. The latter will simply not get responses, no matter how "impressive" you think you are. The moment someone feels that you just sent the same message to others, they will immediately assume you sent it to thousands of people (even if you only sent it to 100). (perhaps I need to better articulate why this doesn't work in your favor... Hmm...)
