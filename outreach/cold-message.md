The cold message is a tool to reach people outside of your network (link to chapter: Leverage your network).

A well crafted, well timed cold message can unlock incredible opportunities and enable you to reach people (and their networks) that you aren't able to reach through your own network.

There are two desired outcomes for a cold message:
1. Pitch yourself directly for a job opportunity and get an interview.
2. Build a long-term relationship with no direct ask for an interview in the short-term.

When to choose which approach? If you're a great fit for the company AND the company is urgently hiring, pitch yourself directly. 

On the other hand, if you see someone who you aspire to learn from, but you may not be a great fit on their team / their not hiring, it's helpful to try and build a long-term relationship with them regardless of any short-term job opportunities that may stem from that relationship. Learning the right skills from the right people will serve you well.

A typical cold message flow:
1. **Build a list of people to cold message**: The most important part of the cold message is picking the right people to cold message. The right message to the wrong person is wasted effort.
2. **Do research on each person**: to understand what they're looking for so that you can pitch yourself / ask for something in a way that's aligned with what they want.
3. **Craft the message** & send.
4. If they reply, follow-up with clear next steps.
5. If they don't reply for a week, gently remind them once a week until they give you a NO / YES.

### Build the list

Your list will comprise of engineers and engineering managers. For each company you reach out to, I recommend messaging 2 engineers and 1 engineering manager (ideally not on the same teams, but it's fine if they are).

The reason for this approach is that even though engineering managers have more decision making power on whether to give you an interview or not, they're often dealing with a lot more communication: email, DMs, etc. and therefore are less likely to respond to something that isn't directly connected to their work. On the other hand, engineers are usually more responsive to cold messages since they get less messages in general.

There are two approaches to buildling a list of people to reach out to: 
1. Company -> engineers. Given a company, find engineers that work there to cold message.
2. Engineers -> company. Given an engineer, learn about their company, and if that company is a good fit, then message the engineer.

**Company -> engineers**

Follow the guidelines in (TODO: link to chapter: ) to build a list of companies that you are a good fit for, and are actively hiring.

Now, the goal for each company is to find at least an engineer and hiring manager + a way to contact them (usually email address).

It's actually quite simple to figure out an email address from a person's name and the domain of the company they work at, so the task is really just finding the profiles of the people you want to reach out to

For each company in this list, there are multiple ways to find engineers & engineering managers:
1. Many companies (especially smaller ones) have an "About us" page that list out their employees, or at least a subset of them. This is a great way to find names and profiles (e.g. LinkedIn, Github, Twitter, etc.)
2. You can use platforms like Wellfound (previously called Angellist Talent - https://wellfound.com) to find profiles of employees at companies.
3. You can directly search in the LinkedIn search bar: "<company_name> software engineer" to find results of LinkedIn profiles that match.
4. Sometimes LinkedIn is too restrictive and only shows a few results. You can Google: "software engineer <company_name> Linkedin". I've found that this usually works better than the LinkedIn search itself.
5. If a company builds anything open source, you can find contributors on their repositories on Github (or wherever the project is hosted).

Once you've found the person, it's time to deduce their email address. Companies generally follow one of the following patterns:
- "<first_name>.<last_name>@<company_domain>"
- "<first_name>@<company_domain>"
- "<first_letter_of_first_name><last_name>@<company_domain>"

You can then use a tool like https://hunter.io/verify/ (or the many other tools out there) to verify whether an email variation is valida and exists.

Some email apps (like Superhuman: https://superhuman.com) have built in email validation, but often these are paid apps.

Depending on your budget, figure out the flow that works for you verify the email addresses.

**Engineer -> company**

The other approach is to hunt for engineers, and validate whether you're a good fit to apply to the open roles (if any) at their companies.

You can use platforms like Github, Angellist, Twitter, open source projects, etc. to find engineers.

### Research

For each person you add to your list, you want to understand what they're working on, what they're excited about and to find any commonalities: shared interests, use similar technology stacks in your projects, went to same institutions, etc.

You want to find the point you can use for the tailored opener in your message.

It helps to dig deep: read a few of their essays / tweets / videos, anything, to get a better sense of what they're thinking about.

### Craft message (pitch for role)

----

**Subject**: An opportunity to show what I can bring to your team

Hi Alice,

(specific ask) Hope you're well. I came across the job listing on your team for an Android engineer, and would appreciate a chance to demonstrate what I can bring to the table.

(proof of competence) Most recently, I designed, developed and grew a note-taking app (link to app) that's loved by dozens. I take pride in writing clean code (link to repo), obsess over functional designs (link to figma files), and care deeply about ensuring that every line of code actually benefits users.

(tailored line) I came across your essay on moving over to Kotlin, and wish I had read it before I had started work on my app. I faced most of the challenges you mentioned and wasted a couple of weeks porting over.

Thanks in advance,

**specific ask**
I recommend starting off with your ask: "appreciate a chance to demonstrate what I can bring to the table" (or some equivalent). Some people prefer to put a tailored line above the ask, as a means to offer some context, but I feel that it's best to be upfront about what you're asking them for. Of course, feel free to A/B test this in your own outreach.

Once they realize what the ask is, you can spend the rest of the email justifying it.

There's no need to ask for a specific time and place to chat. I usually prefer to let them first decide if I'm worth giving an opportunity before I ask for their time.

**Proof of competence**
Your most impressive work and tying it to the job description to justify how your experience **makes you a good fit on their team**. Use links where possible to show you work

In the example above, within the para describing the app, there are links to the app's landing page, the source code, and the Figma design file that makes it easy to understand what the app looks and feels like without even having to download the app to try it out.

Don't just dump every single thing you've done here. Assume the reader will spend 3 seconds tops to absorb what you're saying here. If they like what they see, they can visit the links to know more about aspects of your project that they're interested in, and if they want even more, they'll visit your personal website (after your signature at the bottom of the email) to check out everything you've done.

**Tailored line**
Why you're reaching out to them specifically, instead of anyone else, or spamming their entire company. This is a great place to leverage your research on them. Find the common point that's worth talking about and present it in a gentle way. Don't simply name drop "I read your essay <>, thanks for writing it!", but rather expand on why you like it and how it relates to your work.

Yes, this might take a bit longer to do, but from experience, it's this level of care and tailoring that actually gets responses. And it makes sense: caring about what they are thinking about, and offering a genuine reaction is the bare minimum even you'd want to see when starting a new relationship. And that's what this is essentially: if they respond to this email, they would be starting a new professional relationship with you. The ask is big, so showing your commitment to caring about their work is helpful.

**More links**
After your signature, share your personal website so that they can deep dive into all of your work as they desire.

### Follow-up

If they don't respond within a week, gently follow-up. The best way to follow-up is to have an update to share: e.g. an update to your project, an essay that you wrote, etc. This is especially powerful when you follow up repeatedly with more updates to share: in a way it signals your productivity.

"Hey Alice, hope you're well. Hoping to take just a few minutes of your time to chat about how I can effectively contribute on your team. Thanks in advance!

-- Karthik

p.s. <> - an essay I recently published on advice to folks who are just getting started with iOS development."

If you don't have any update, still follow-up with just the reminder.

### Tips
Use an email read tracker to know when a cold email has been opened. This is important to undestand  whether people are even opening your email.

If very few people are actually opening your email, you have a subject line issue. If they're opening your email, but not responding, you'll likely have to tweak your messaging some way, or improve how you pitch your proof of competence.

But sometimes, it just takes a few rounds of following up in order to get a response.
