The cold message is a tool to reach people outside of your network (link to chapter: Leverage your network).

A well crafted, well timed cold message can unlock incredible opportunities and enable you to reach people (and their networks) that you aren't able to reach through your own network. 

The art of cold messaging will help with almost any endeavor in life: from building a business, getting your work out to the world, finding roommates, and of course job hunting as well. While the applications may be different, you can adapt the fundamental principles below to other situations.

A typical cold message flow:
1. **Build a list of people to cold message**: The most important part of the cold message is picking the right people to cold message. The right message to the wrong person is wasted effort.
2. **Do research on each person**: to understand what they're looking for so that you can pitch yourself / ask for something in a way that's aligned with what they want.
3. **Craft the message** & send.
4. If they reply, follow-up with clear next steps.
5. If they don't reply for a week, gently remind them once a week until they give you a NO / YES.

### Build the list
- Who are you looking for?
- How to use LinkedIn, Github, Twitter to find people.
- Deducing their email / choosing an alternate channel (e.g. Twitter DM).

### Research
- What does this person care about?
	- Check out their writing / tweets / videos, anything if they have them.
- Do you share anything in common?
- What are they building at their company? Read job description. Understand their product at a high level, & if you have time play with it.
