Making friends in Tech is a great way to build your network. Meeting new people will expose you to new ideas, perspectives and opportunities that will help you far beyond just landing your next job.

Need to rewrite this and base it on:
1. You are the average of the people you surround yourself with. If you want to become great at a skill it'll serve you incredibly well to surround yourself with folks that are great at that skill. This is the reason why people with shared interests congregate in densely packed "hubs" for their domains. Fortunately there are many Tech hubs in the world, so you don't have to grab a flight to San Francisco necessarily to take advantage of this, but I still highly recommend finding a way to a Tech hub.
2. Many benefits to building this skill outside of just job hunting.

This approach requires you to be in a place that's a Tech hub: i.e. a place with a cluster of technology companies and a vibrant ecosystem of people. Ideally with many meetups / events, cafes where people work out of, and social gatherings.

The crux of forming effectively engaging with people in person is to be authentic. This is tougher than it sounds: we all have this tendency to project a happy, successful, intelligent version of ourselves to the world - and especially so to strangers.

Personally, I've found it a lot easier to connect with people after I started being more honest about who I am, the challenges that I'm going through, and sharing what I'm genuinely excited about rather than sharing ideas and thoughts to impress the other person. 

In the desert of inauthenticity, your authenticity will be welcomed.

### Cafes

Engaging with strangers at cafes is perhaps the most difficult scenario to approach someone because the situation doesn't necessarily call for an interaction, and so it's entirely on you to initiate it the right way to hopefully lead to a healthy conversation.

The right person to approach is someone who's not actively working on something, doesn't have headphones on, and who seems to be waiting, perhaps by scrolling on their phone, or just relaxing.

You can be subtle about it: "Hey, what did you order, that looks nice!", and transition that into a conversation.

You can also be direct: "Hey, I'm new to town and looking to meet new people, do you mind if I join you for tea?".

Play around with it and see what works for you. The goal is to get the conversation flowing and eventually, hopefully, lead to chatting about what they're excited about, what they're working on, etc. 

Most people are willing to chat if you approach them in a friendly manner.

Make sure to take their contact info (email / number - whatever they're comfortable with) before you leave.

### Social gatherings

Everyone's already there to meet other people, so generally it's a lot easier to approach folks and chat. The tougher part is finding them. If you 

### Hobbies

My first internship was through a conversation on a basketball court right before a pickup game. 

My first consulting gig with a Big Tech company was through a friend I made at a volunteering event.

My first job at a startup was through a warm introduction (a friend connected me to a friend).

You never know where opportunities rise from.

Being good at something garners respect. And people tend to translate respect in one domain to other domains (whether warranted or not). So if you're good at, say, basketball, playing basketball in a Tech hub will likely open you up to a bunch of connections that work in Tech, who also respect you for you ability to play basketball.

So consider pursuing your hobbies in Tech hubs to make friends who work in the industry you want to get into.

### You're going to suck

It's not easy to strike conversations with strangers. You're going to be rejected many times. You'll be ignored. Sometimes it might get awkward and you'll have to cut the conversation short and leave.

That is natural. But if you can build one meaningful connection out of a handful of rejections, you've gained a lot and lost almost nothing.
