The goal of outreach is to pitch yourself to engineers or engineering managers at companies that you’d like to work at - in order to get interviews there.

Outreach is the process of reaching out to people with a specific ask. What your ask is depends on how close you are to them, and whether they work at a company that you’re planning to apply to, or they know people that do work at such companies.

The first step in outreach is to build the Outreach List: a spreadsheet of people to reach out to. The initial seed for this list is your "network".

Think of your network as a graph of nodes with each node representing a person, and an edge between two nodes represents a connection between them (i.e. knowing each other). The distance between the two nodes is proportional to how well they know each other. For example, if you met someone at a conference a year ago, but haven't talked to since, you're "far away" from this node in your network. On the other hand, a close friend / colleague who you work(ed) with day in and day out for an extended period of time would be very "close" in your network.

The goal is to grow your network such that you become connected to more engineers and hiring managers who you can pitch yourself to, in order to gain internal referrals at the companies you want to work at.

There are 2 ways to grow your network: 
1. Through the connections you already have in your network (via introductions: the process of two people connecting via a mutual friend).
2. By connecting with people through "cold" outreach: i.e. reaching out to them directly without a mutual friend introducing you.

Both approaches are incredibly useful.

If your network is weak (you don't know many engineers / they don't work at the companies that you want to work at / they're not well connected to people that work at the companies you want to work at), then it's incredibly difficult and time consuming to use your network to reach the people you want to reach.

This is when cold outreach is invaluable: it's a technique to reach people that are outside of your network that would have been difficult / impossible to reach through people you already know.

Introductions through your network have a much higher response rate than cold outreach. But cold outreach can be life changing because all you need is to make one connection with the right person to open yourself to an entire new network of people that you'd be grateful to engage with.

Most people reading this underestimate the value of a single connection because you haven't developed the skill to leverage a connection effectively. With the right pitch, approach, attitude and persistence, you should be able to create introductions to 3 more people from a single person.

Therefore, through cold outreach if you can connect with a stellar engineer / technologist and impress them, then you should be able to gain introductions to 3 of their connections. 
And then 3 more from each of those 3 connections ( = 9)
And then 3 more from each of those 9 ( = 27)

This leads to an exponential growth in your network. And not only just growth, but high quality growth because people that are great at what they do tend to be clustered together, so by connecting with one great person, you're now one degree separated from the entire "People-that-are-great-at-what-they-do Network"

It really is a small world. A single, well crafted, cold message really can change your life.

### Channels

This section will show you the 3 main channels to utilize and grow your network to earn interviews:
1. Leverage your network: connect with those you know and get introductions to folks they know to grow your network.
2. Cold message: directly reach out to engineers / engineering managers to pitch yourself to them for a job interview.
3. Approach people in person (Approach strangers, Drop into offices, meet people at events, etc.) to grow your network.

### Managing the outreach process

It's important to have some kind of system that helps you keep track of who you need to reach out to, who you need to follow-up with, what the next steps are, etc.

It would be sad to put in all the effort to pitch yourself to someone only to forget to follow-up, forget to respond, or completely miss their reply because it went into spam (sadly happened to me once).

Your system doesn't have to be anything special or fancy. I recommend creating a spreadsheet on Notion / Airtable / Google sheets in which you have the following tabs:

Tabs:
1. **People**: Every single person you're planning to reach out to / have reached out to.
2. **Companies**: The companies you're interested in applying to.

In the People tab, have (at least) the following columns:
1. **Name**
2. **Contact** (either email / the platform where you'll reach out)
3. **Role** (e.g. "engineer", "designer")
4. **LinkedIn** (or other relevant profile)
5. **Status** ("To reach out", "Waiting for reply", "Ongoing conversation", "Succcess" / "Fail")
6. **Next actions** (After you've chatted with the person you reached out to, use this column to keep track of what you have to do next. E.g. "Follow-up with request for introduction to Alice".)
7. **Intro path** (Do you have a way to get connected to this person through people you know? E.g. "Alice -> Bob -> John" would be a way of representing that you can reach this person John, through Bob, who you can reach through your contact Alice.)
8. **Notes** (Take notes of every single conversation you have with anyone! Summarize what you talked about, any links / resources they shared, etc. This is generally a great habit because you can revise this before your next conversation with them )
