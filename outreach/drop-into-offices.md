An almost guaranteed way to get noticed by a company is to drop off a letter in which you pitch yourself for an opportunity at the company - at the company's office.

Almost always your letter will be read. And since it's a physical letter, the recipient is likely to spend more time on it than an email (since they likely get a ton of emails).

The downside to this approach is that it can take time to physically visit the offices of companies you're applying to, and due to covid restrictions some offices have been shut down / not fully functioning. 

Choose a Tech hub that you're able to visit.

Make a list of the companies there that meet your criteria (TODO link to: "Qualifying companies") that are headquartered in this Tech hub. You can make a list by using tools like Angellist, LinkedIn, Googling.

For each company, identify an engineering manager on a team that's hiring.

Craft a message directed to that hiring manager. You can use the methodology in "Cold Message" (Link to: "Cold Message") to craft your message to pitch yourself. Print it out. In addition to the message, make sure to include your phone number and email address so that they know how to reach you.

Put the printed message, and your resume in an envelop directed to the engineering manager at the company that you're looking to get an interview at.

Walk into the office. Most offices have a reception area that is responsible for checking in guests and handling deliveries. You can directly hand them your envelop mentioning that it's for the hiring manager you addressed it to. If asked what it is, you can openly mention that you're applying for a position and that the envelop contains my resume and a pitch for why you think you'd be a great fit.
