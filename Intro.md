Over the past few years, I've helped dozens of engineers strategize and execute successful job hunting campaigns.

I've noticed that most people don't understand the art of job hunting. I feel sad when I see an engineer who's technically sound, spend hours practicing interview questions, and yet fails to get interviews to able to showcase their competence that they've worked so hard to craft. A tragedy.

For most of you, your biggest challenge isn't interviewing, it's getting interviews. 
This playbook will show you how to effectively get interviews & radically improve your job hunting outcomes.

If you don't look "traditionally good" on paper: didn't go to a well known college (or didn't attend college), and haven't yet worked at a company that people recognize - this playbook will teach you how to create opportunities at great companies when it may seem like there are none.

If you are getting interviews, this playbook will show you how to get even more interviews at those especially hard to reach places that you'd love to work at, but for some reason they don't seem to notice you.

Why me? 

I have a non-traditional background: while I went to a top computer science program, I left college without graduating - moved out to SF and joined an early stage startup that I was excited to work at. After that startup experience, in the process of job hunting for my second job, I quickly realized that the standard approach of "apply to companies and wait" was the absolute worst way to job hunt. 

My circumstances forced me to explore a variety of tactics to get noticed by companies that I wanted to work at. Through cold emails, warm introductions, Twitter DMs, and even walking into companies to chat with them about open positions - I was able to successfully get interviews despite not having an impressive resume at that point in my life.

I used my experience to help friends radically improve their job hunting campaigns & I hope this system will serve you as well.

The art of job hunting is a skill that keeps giving. The ability to pitch yourself well will continue to unlock opportunities for you throughout life. At its core, this playbook shows you the mindset you need to pro-actively create opportunities for yourself no matter what your objective is.

Lastly, I can't take full credit for the strategies I've outlined in this book. I'm incredibly grateful for my friends and colleagues that have taught me how to effectively job hunt from their hard-fought experiences, and those that have given me detailed feedback on versions of this playbook. Thank you.

From the bottom of my heart I wish that you're able to build a career that brings you great fulfillment and happiness. All the best.



Outline
1. The catalyst that pushed me to write this.
2. Re-explain peoples' problems back to them: over-indexing on acing technical interviews, and not enough time spent on learning how to actually get interviews! This is an art that isn't taught well anywhere I've looked - and definitely not at colleges.
3. Vision: to fill this missing knowledge gap.
4. My personal story and why I'm a GREAT fit to write this book.
5. Feedback from experts and great job hunters.
6. Describe the state of their mind after going through the playbook: plant a seed of desire to want to read this book.
