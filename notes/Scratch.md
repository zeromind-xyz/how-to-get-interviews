I want a visual language to communicate 

### Your Pitch outline
- Your pitch is: demonstrating your competence in a way that minimizes perceived risk for a company you're applying to.
- Crafting your pitch is the foundation for every resource you'll prepare (resume, website, projects), and for effectively engaging with companies (via cold emails, warm introductions, direct messages, etc.).
- Pitching yourself boils down to demonstrating your competence in a way that minimizes the perceived risk for a company (bec. companies are about risk minimization (link to that piece of playbook)).
- Characteristics of the best pitch: 
	- Irrefutable demonstrations of competence.
	- Succinct. (the signals of competence, the shorter your pitch).
- In the coming chapters, you'll see how to express your pitch in various mediums.
- 

Damn bro, want to be in BLR? Nope. This is where I want to be. Just having a weird day. Push through it. Meditate more (this is the solution to every damn problem that you have. Sila. Samadhi. Panna). That's it.

Outline for opening:
- Basic economics of a company.
- Why does a company hire?
- What is hiring?
- Steps in the hiring process
- Understanding roles: Recruiter, Hiring manager, engineer
- Recruiters have to rely on proxy signals of competence (define this and give examples)
- What if you don't have the signals recruiters look for? The most effective way is to bypass the recruiter screen entirely.

- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33833420 -> ChatGPT can solve Leetcode questions. Lol. This could be an interesting tool for job hunters.
	- Would love to embed this in some kind of programming environment, that would surely be interestin.
	- Human in the loop approaches make a lot of sense. Still need that final layer of "approval" before sending an output through.
- Where to talk about the advantages of applying to startups vs. Big Tech - based on your background?? This isn't a part of qualifying ("fit" in this section only has to do with whether you can create value for this company or not, nothing else - because if you believe you can, it's on you to sell effectively to that company), this is a part of the "Approach" strategy - ought to be a chapter at the start of the "Approach section". This is valuable information.

## From chapter "Qualifying companies":

**A. Understand what a company wants**

* Different types of engineering (while the fundamentals of working on a map vs. a payments API do require the same fundamental software engineering principles, they are radically different expressions).
* Iterating quickly on a web app with React is a very different game than building a database and optimizing it with clever data structures & algorithms. One isn't better than the other, they require a different way of using your mind.
* By understanding which flavor of engineer this company is looking for, you can understand 1. whether you're a good fit for that role, and if so, 2. which of your past experiences you can highlight in all of your interactions with this company.
* If you have a background building web apps and a company is building a database in C++ and other low-level engineering techniques and optimizations, you're probably not going to get far with this company. Sure apply online and see what happens, but don't dedicate a lot of time trying to convince the company to interview you, it's not going to be fruitful.
* Selling a product that isn't a good fit for customer isn't going to be very fruitful. Focus energies on the opportunities that you are a good fit for.
* (Something something overestimate the average point - need to instill confidence in those that actually have the skills).
* I'm not saying don't apply to a position that asks for Python but you only know Javascript. The reality is that it's relatively easy for a person competent in one language to pick up another and good companies understand this. But I am saying that you should avoid companies that need a very different flavor of engineering, unless you're prepared to spend time learning before you actually work there.
  * Funny story: my email interaction with George Hotz: (LOL, this is a great email interaction). https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/george+hotz/FMfcgxmRRSkQTxvhWvpXZDLNTgfjmnfk (HAHAHAHA).
    * This is actually a perfect representation of what not to do.

**B. Gauge your ability to create value for the company**

* I believe most of you reading this are underestimating your abilities.
* We tend to overestimate the average and underestimate the extremes. It's both true that the best engineer is 1000x more productive than the average and that the average engineer can't build a meaningful application on their own, without major bugs, in a reasonable amount of time.
* If you have baseline competence in software engineering, communication skills, the right attitude (ability to handle feedback well, always working to improve), and some common sense, you're well ahead of the pack. Of course, you'll always have a huge room for improvement and that's what you should focus on, but when it's time to job hunt, don't sell yourself short - it's not a helpful mindset.
* I wish everyone reading this gets an opportunity to process hundreds of software engineer job applications from around the world. You'll quickly realize what I mean by overestimating the mean.
* Another contributing factor is that those who are dedicated to learning will often consume content from great programmers on Youtube / TikTok / Twitch / Hackernews, etc. When you constantly consume from people who are really good (outliers), it's natural for you to feel inadequate compared to them (I definitely felt this way). Those that are actually learning a lot might be the ones most susceptible to undervaluing their skills. This is great for learning, bad for selling.
* I think it's helpful to have some cognitive dissonance: allow yourself to be humbled by the greats on a regular basis and let your "feel" for the average climb. But when it's time to job hunt, turn that system off and have a more realistic gauge of your competence. If in doubt, bias towards greater confidence.
  * More tips to increase confidence that I've found to be super helpful:
    * I've found that relentless practice is a great way to boost confidence in anything: whether it's taking the game winning shot, giving a speech in front of a large audience, and interviewing at companies.
    * I have stage fright, but I know with enough practice there comes a point when I'll be able to go out there and deliver a speech with confidence and ease.
    * Depending on your level of fear / lack of confidence, I suggest putting even more effort into the practice.
    * And you have to. Natalie Portman, Kobe Bryant, Steve Jobs all practiced for a stupid amount of time before their scenes / game-winning shots / world-class product presentations. They practiced so much that you & I felt like they were born to do this.
    * **For job hunting, there are a variety of ways you'll need to practice:**
      * Actual technical competence.
      * Your pitch (I want a section in which I outline some strategies that I've found incredibly useful in my life to deal with lack of confidence and fears).

**How badly a company needs to hire**

* Imagine you're trying to sell a car. One potential customer is a couple who already have a car, but are considering another car to reduce the coordination hassle in sharing a car. They can make do with what they have, but it's be kind of nice to buy another car. Another potential customer doesn't have a car and needs one to commute every day to their new job 20 miles away. Who do you think you'll have an easier time selling a car to? (Need a better, more terse example, this is way too long). (UNNECESSARY ANALOGY. Just get straight to an example with companies).
* Similarly, not all companies who list jobs have the same urgency to hire someone for a particular. One company might have a massive desire to hire because their product is growing at an alarming rate. Meanwhile another company might have an opening for a role that they don't reeallly need to fill today, but are hiring for it to meet some internal goal or because some engineering manager in the company was promised a certain team size and she's just hiring because she can.
