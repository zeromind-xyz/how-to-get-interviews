Pitch chapter (now removed)

Your pitch is a quick demonstration of your abilities, usually shared in written format and is likely the first thing people see.

There are 3 variations of your pitch - following the 3-30-30 rule:
1. One-liner (reader spends 3 seconds)
2. Blurb (reader spends 30 seconds)
3. Link to website with all of your work (30m).

### One-liner
Your one-liner is the most important string of words you'll craft. If it doesn't hook the reader in a few seconds, they'll likely not read anything that follows. It should quickly demonstrate your most impressive work.

"I've built products at Acme (link) & Bacme (link) that directly increased revenue by millions. I specialize in search and recommendations".

"I designed, developed and marketed a note taking app (link to app) that has dozens of active users."

### Blurb

- I've also 

### Links

### Putting it all together

### Resume outline

**Intro**
- What is a resume (CV)?
- Who is the audience?

**Organization**
- Overview w/ example resume
- Experiences is the most important aspect of your resume and should come up front and center.
	- Why education should come after experiences.

**Work experiences**
- Purpose of brand.
- Titles are not as important as you think.
	- (unless the company is very well known). No consensus on the difference b/w Sr. engineer and engineer, not as important as you think.

**How to describe an experience**
- Maximize strength of your company brand to your audience.
- Each bullet point:
	- Tie to outcome (the **right** outcome).
		- The further connected the outcome is from your action, the more doubt it creates in the mind of the reader.
		- Direct business outcomes: users, revenue
		- Indirect business outcomes: 
			- Improved latency.
			- Improved load times.
			- Employee training material.
	- Simple language.
	- Terse.

**Projects**
- Don't call yourself a founder / ceo if you didn't actually have any users for your project / didn't have the intention of building a business out of it. People tend to want to use the word "Founder" / "CEO" because it sounds more impressive than just saying you "created" a project, but it's totally fine to call it just that. It's easy to tell if your project was intended to be a project, or a company and it just sounds 

**Design**
- Design philosophy.
	- Copy >>> design. Don't let bad design get in way of your copy. If you don't know what you're doing (w.r.t. design), don't implement your own design & just copy a template. Please.
	- **Substance >>> flash**. In fact, unnecessary flash comes off as lacking competence: as if you're trying to cover up a lack of experience with colors and shit that doesn't correspond to competence in your work.
- Please avoid any bar graphs, pie charts, etc. Your experiences is your primary pitch, not self-proclaimed proficiency (or lack thereof) of skills.
- Link decorations.
- Colors (how to draw the eye to what matters).
- Just use a fucking template. Plz.
- Web and PDF -> Have both (or rather, have pdf with links). 

**What to avoid**
- Cut "Objective".
- self professed skills "great communicator". Demonstrate, don't tell.
- Avoid jargon.

**Tailor to region**
- Learn how to get feedback: reach out to engineers in your region to see if you need to do something region specific!

**Tips**
- Handling gaps in resume
- Lying is a poor strategy
- Effective templates you can use (references).

**Resources**
- https://old.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/qhg5jo/this_resume_got_me_an_interview/ (Power of {brandname} on resume) -> probably want to put this in the chapter 
- "As a hiring manager, most of the “Increased revenue by 27%” type lines on tech resumes are clearly awkward attempts to implement generic Internet resume advice. When was the last time a company attributed sales growth to some developer making a change? Don’t try to take credit for things that the company, as a whole, accomplished." - this makes sense: randomly dropping numbers isn't the best way to approach it. He goes on to mention WHERE it makes sense:
	- **The two places I like to see specific numbers are when communicating project scale or demonstrating some quantifiable change that was directly attributable to a person’s work** (this is a GREAT point - when you state outcomes further away from the work you did, the correlation b/w YOUR work and that outcome is more blurry => more doubt in what you actually did).
		- “Reduced AWS bill by 40% by profiling server code and implementing strategic optimizations”
		- “Architected cloud backend to support 500,000 daily users”
		- “Reduced average page load time by 57% percent”
- "You want something that indicates the scale, scope, and complexity of what you did. I don't care that you increased user engagement by X%. I care that you've designed and implemented the type of things that I need designef and implemented."
	- "**Improved the performance of a rendering system from 10000 objects per second to 100000"**.
		- "Super vague, means basically nothing. Maybe it should be written with a bit more detail about what kind of rendering system this is. Still I would be interested, and in the interview I would ask them to explain the system and what they did. However, if it was something stupid (the original code was just super bad) then they would look dumb for bringing it up. Basically, if you put something like this in your CV, it should be something you're proud of for a good reason, not a result of trying to think of _anything_ where you can reduce the impact of your work to a number."
		- (This is really interesting)
		- "**The impact of most work cannot be reduced to a number, so it's perfectly fine to not have any "measurable successes" like that in your CV**. In my experience, 75% of people don't, and 75% of people who do have stupid ones that just make them look worse (ie they read online resume-writing advice and put in something like the example this discussion is about). So there is no point in actively trying to think of something like that to put in your CV. If you _have_ something, put it in, if not, that's fine. There's a pretty good way to decide whether to include it: does imagining your interviewer reading it make you feel proud or embarrassed?"
			- Beautiful point.
- Lying is pointless (imo), but give a rational argument for why not to lie NOT a moral one (bec. there is no moral argument to not lying).
- Rather than "reduce AWS cost by 30%", more effective is to state the absolute number it started at AND how it was critical to business to reduce it (drop in the revenue of the business at that moment to show the cost saving in relation to the business).
	- Use absolute numbers rather than percentages when the absolute number tells a better story.
- Testimonials: I think this can be a powerful tool especially when you don't have any personal brands to go off of - use the brand of someone else vouching for you. (NOPE - bec. w/out verification, they mean jack shite)

- Example resume on ShareLaTeX: [https://www.sharelatex.com/project/55db6ac384d1be370a7d4b9a](https://www.sharelatex.com/project/55db6ac384d1be370a7d4b9a) 
	- **Treat it like an engineering problem. Analyze your funnel - what companies/opportunities are you starting with? What's your conversion rate between funnel steps? How can you increase that?**
	- And, vitally, how can you **put yourself in the shoes of the person on the other side**? How can you simulate their perspective? At every point of interaction with you, if you were them, what would you think? And given that knowledge, how can you improve what you're doing?
	-  Other things: check out @sehurlburt on Twitter, Stephanie gives great advice on this topic. Also search around and read threads like the following: [https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/23e4df/entry_l...](https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/23e4df/entry_level_engineers_who_are_now_hired_what_got/)
- The words, layout and spacing of your resume is FAR more important than any other unnecessary, often distracting, cosmetic enhancements.
	- (e.g. plain text, minimally formatted with the right spacing can work wonders).

	- I got my first two jobs probably as a result of my github activity.
		That makes sense. You're showing small contributions which is what's expected of a junior engineer. It showcases that you can actually write some code. However, as you advance in your career, the expectation is that you will work on higher level concepts. Github profiles aren't really a place I've seen used to showcase architecture and design skills, nor how candidates work with others, and those things matter significantly more than a 20 line patch in an open source library for a Lead+ engineer.

		The parent poster was asking for advice as a Principal Engineer. At that level, they aren't going to be writing much code on a daily basis, so their Github profile is not very relevant to the job at hand. That level is VP equivalent or higher at most companies, and most engineers will not achieve it. It comes without the people management, but is most definitely a leadership position.

MORE NOTES

I think "Your pitch" is actually necessary & actually more important than the Resume chapter. Your pitch is used absolutely everywhere -> designing a powerful one-liner, blurb and short essay are incredibly important for every piece of communication you have with the world.

Amen. Let's put that chapter back in at the top: Your pitch.

### Your Pitch outline
- Your pitch is: demonstrating your competence in a way that minimizes perceived risk for a company you're applying to.
- Crafting your pitch is the foundation for every resource you'll prepare (resume, website, projects), and for effectively engaging with companies (via cold emails, warm introductions, direct messages, etc.).
- Pitching yourself boils down to demonstrating your competence in a way that minimizes the perceived risk for a company (bec. companies are about risk minimization (link to that piece of playbook)).
- Characteristics of the best pitch: 
	- Irrefutable demonstrations of competence.
	- Succinct. (the signals of competence, the shorter your pitch).
- In the coming chapters, you'll see how to express your pitch in various mediums.
- 

Damn bro, want to be in BLR? Nope. This is where I want to be. Just having a weird day. Push through it. Meditate more (this is the solution to every damn problem that you have. Sila. Samadhi. Panna). That's it.

Outline for opening:
- Basic economics of a company.
- Why does a company hire?
- What is hiring?
- Steps in the hiring process
- Understanding roles: Recruiter, Hiring manager, engineer
- Recruiters have to rely on proxy signals of competence (define this and give examples)
- What if you don't have the signals recruiters look for? The most effective way is to bypass the recruiter screen entirely.

- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33833420 -> ChatGPT can solve Leetcode questions. Lol. This could be an interesting tool for job hunters.
	- Would love to embed this in some kind of programming environment, that would surely be interestin.
	- Human in the loop approaches make a lot of sense. Still need that final layer of "approval" before sending an output through.
- Where to talk about the advantages of applying to startups vs. Big Tech - based on your background?? This isn't a part of qualifying ("fit" in this section only has to do with whether you can create value for this company or not, nothing else - because if you believe you can, it's on you to sell effectively to that company), this is a part of the "Approach" strategy - ought to be a chapter at the start of the "Approach section". This is valuable information.

## From chapter "Qualifying companies":

**A. Understand what a company wants**

* Different types of engineering (while the fundamentals of working on a map vs. a payments API do require the same fundamental software engineering principles, they are radically different expressions).
* Iterating quickly on a web app with React is a very different game than building a database and optimizing it with clever data structures & algorithms. One isn't better than the other, they require a different way of using your mind.
* By understanding which flavor of engineer this company is looking for, you can understand 1. whether you're a good fit for that role, and if so, 2. which of your past experiences you can highlight in all of your interactions with this company.
* If you have a background building web apps and a company is building a database in C++ and other low-level engineering techniques and optimizations, you're probably not going to get far with this company. Sure apply online and see what happens, but don't dedicate a lot of time trying to convince the company to interview you, it's not going to be fruitful.
* Selling a product that isn't a good fit for customer isn't going to be very fruitful. Focus energies on the opportunities that you are a good fit for.
* (Something something overestimate the average point - need to instill confidence in those that actually have the skills).
* I'm not saying don't apply to a position that asks for Python but you only know Javascript. The reality is that it's relatively easy for a person competent in one language to pick up another and good companies understand this. But I am saying that you should avoid companies that need a very different flavor of engineering, unless you're prepared to spend time learning before you actually work there.
  * Funny story: my email interaction with George Hotz: (LOL, this is a great email interaction). https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/george+hotz/FMfcgxmRRSkQTxvhWvpXZDLNTgfjmnfk (HAHAHAHA).
    * This is actually a perfect representation of what not to do.

**B. Gauge your ability to create value for the company**

* I believe most of you reading this are underestimating your abilities.
* We tend to overestimate the average and underestimate the extremes. It's both true that the best engineer is 1000x more productive than the average and that the average engineer can't build a meaningful application on their own, without major bugs, in a reasonable amount of time.
* If you have baseline competence in software engineering, communication skills, the right attitude (ability to handle feedback well, always working to improve), and some common sense, you're well ahead of the pack. Of course, you'll always have a huge room for improvement and that's what you should focus on, but when it's time to job hunt, don't sell yourself short - it's not a helpful mindset.
* I wish everyone reading this gets an opportunity to process hundreds of software engineer job applications from around the world. You'll quickly realize what I mean by overestimating the mean.
* Another contributing factor is that those who are dedicated to learning will often consume content from great programmers on Youtube / TikTok / Twitch / Hackernews, etc. When you constantly consume from people who are really good (outliers), it's natural for you to feel inadequate compared to them (I definitely felt this way). Those that are actually learning a lot might be the ones most susceptible to undervaluing their skills. This is great for learning, bad for selling.
* I think it's helpful to have some cognitive dissonance: allow yourself to be humbled by the greats on a regular basis and let your "feel" for the average climb. But when it's time to job hunt, turn that system off and have a more realistic gauge of your competence. If in doubt, bias towards greater confidence.
  * More tips to increase confidence that I've found to be super helpful:
    * I've found that relentless practice is a great way to boost confidence in anything: whether it's taking the game winning shot, giving a speech in front of a large audience, and interviewing at companies.
    * I have stage fright, but I know with enough practice there comes a point when I'll be able to go out there and deliver a speech with confidence and ease.
    * Depending on your level of fear / lack of confidence, I suggest putting even more effort into the practice.
    * And you have to. Natalie Portman, Kobe Bryant, Steve Jobs all practiced for a stupid amount of time before their scenes / game-winning shots / world-class product presentations. They practiced so much that you & I felt like they were born to do this.
    * **For job hunting, there are a variety of ways you'll need to practice:**
      * Actual technical competence.
      * Your pitch (I want a section in which I outline some strategies that I've found incredibly useful in my life to deal with lack of confidence and fears).

**How badly a company needs to hire**

* Imagine you're trying to sell a car. One potential customer is a couple who already have a car, but are considering another car to reduce the coordination hassle in sharing a car. They can make do with what they have, but it's be kind of nice to buy another car. Another potential customer doesn't have a car and needs one to commute every day to their new job 20 miles away. Who do you think you'll have an easier time selling a car to? (Need a better, more terse example, this is way too long). (UNNECESSARY ANALOGY. Just get straight to an example with companies).
* Similarly, not all companies who list jobs have the same urgency to hire someone for a particular. One company might have a massive desire to hire because their product is growing at an alarming rate. Meanwhile another company might have an opening for a role that they don't reeallly need to fill today, but are hiring for it to meet some internal goal or because some engineering manager in the company was promised a certain team size and she's just hiring because she can.
