Visual
- **Visual language for textual analysis** - want to use this throughout the playbook (esp in the Resume, cold emailing, warm introductions sections). This is absolutely essential to analyze sentences well.

Landing page
- Have a section to showcase the visual design in the playbook (this is a major selling point. Encapsulate each "major" point in a diagram and showcase in this section of the landing page) - do this AFTER the beta reader feedback. Amen.
