**To talk about**
- Need to really bring clarity to the high level timeline and heuristics on how to spend your time (e.g. if you don't have an impressive project, etc.).
- There's a good chapter on "Ask for help" in general (I think all of these tidbits of advice can fall into a "Tips" section - which could be clubbed together with "Mindset" advice as well).
	- **Don't feel like you're a burden**
		When I first moved to San Francisco right after dropping out of college, looking to join an exciting startup, I was shocked, surprised and deeply moved by how complete strangers were willing to listen to my ideas, offer their feedback and extend help. I felt I didn't deserve it, and I didn't even understand why they'd take time out of their busy lives to help me with anything. Therefore I'd feel nervous to even ask for help or set up warm-up meetings. As I gained experience and found myself able to offer feedback & advice to others, I learned that supporting others and being able to help others on their paths is a deeply fulfilling and satisfying experience. If I had experientially understood the benefits of supporting others sooner in my career, I think I would have asked way more people for coffees / catch-ups without fearing that I was taking up too much of their time. Sooner or later, you'll be able to offer help in return, and I hope as you build your fulfilling career, you too will find the joy in helping those that are earlier than you in their careers.

- Need a chapter on "**moving to a Tech hub for your job hunt**". This is actually really important. And there are definitely hacks to reducing the cost of living in a Tech hub. Seriously. Super impoortant.
- Tooling: walking through the Notion template for the CRM (that readers can duplicate). I think this goes in the "approach" section, as its own chapter (or part of an "Intro" chapter).
- It's important for readers to understand the different types of Tech companies and how they differ in what they look for (e.g. Big Tech vs. startups vs. legacy tech companies -> IBMs, SAPs of the world). -> Bec. the game plan is honestly different. Another route is to narrow the scope of the playbook to ignore legacy tech (or perhaps a disclaimer that talks about how).
	- This definitely needs to be in "How companies hire" -> Go into decent depth there and reference that section in other areas. (I want # link to each header of this playbook - for more specific linking to the right sections).
- **Steering conversation**: I think I'll talk about this in the "in-person approach". An important general philosophy on how to approach any conversation really. A fascinating topic.
- **Tighten the scope of the audience**: only look to help those that can build a basic CRUD app. Those that can't even build this should first build themselves up this way before I'm able to help them.
- Rework "projects" chapter w/ far more hand holding. It's too intimidating as it stands right now.
- Have to explain how to choose most impressive past work. That's tough to do, and currently I haven't even talked about how that decision is made.
- Using your GPA / previous accomplishments unrelated to engineering could be useful in demonstrating competence - in the absence of more relevent engineering experiences. Need to address this somewhere. Definitely in one of intro chapters: it needs to clearly communicate 
- You don't need to build a "hard" technical problem to be impressive in the eyes of companies. Value = the use it provides others, NOT how difficult it was to build. You must adjust mental model of what is valuable to this.
- Special projects: https://twitter.com/pie6k/status/1606371846219304961?s=20&t=SKoB2GzGXpdEmxtlUbi4_w (really cool.)
- The power of writing essays: https://perell.com/podcast/patrick-mckenzie-internet-famous/ 
	- "But if the only thing you got out of writing an essay about whatever the topic is for you is that the next time you’re doing a job search when you are writing cold emails to hiring managers for whatever the position is that you’re going after, you can use that one essay that you wrote back in the as a proof-of-work on like, “Hey, I have clearly thought about this more than most people who are sending you a cold email with a link to a resume that you’re gonna skim for 30 seconds.” -> this is genius.
- https://twitter.com/hiangelali/status/1611056476537356292?s=20&t=Pkj7aDZCSh8QrBiTgG0Snw -> Job hunting is incredibly stressful. The people reading this playbook are probably going through their most stressful phase in life yet. Write with care.

**Visual**
- https://manual.withcompound.com/chapters/early-exercising-and-83-b-elections?collection=early-stage-founder -> this is the format that I want. I think the "share" links at the top are absolutely genius. It enables each essay to have its own traction that then raises all the other essays in the playbook. A powerful approach.
- I definitely need to have a separate visual language to point out feedback on text such as email templates, etc. I don't see a way around designing this in Figma and exporting. It's such a huge explanation value-add, that it's worth the additional effort. Done.
- **Visual language for textual analysis** - want to use this throughout the playbook (esp in the Resume, cold emailing, warm introductions sections). This is absolutely essential to analyze sentences well.
- https://getcoleman.com/ -> incredible way to present a morphing pitch. Might make sense to steal this format. If not, then at least present it in a beautiful way (Figma export rather than just as text in the page. Emphasize each pitch version and make it look beautiful).
- https://twitter.com/nandafyi/status/1605975563902279681?s=20&t=heu7sezE4zpfErjD8P04hA -> Amen. More Framer Motion genius.

-> This is a neat interface to show an improvement. Can use for something like explaining cold email messaging, etc.: by starting with a bad example, and iterating on it to something solid.
![[email-template-design.jpg]]
- ^ This is a powerful way to represent a cold email template. Might steal design, but make it more minimal, and better.
- When it's time to actually build out a custom reading experience (only after many iterations w/ a simple Gitbook draft), will want to be able to embed a Notion template in the middle of the article. E.g. like at the bottom of: https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/how-to-run-openais-whisper-speech-recognition-model/ (there's an embedded Airtable).
	- And "ideally" would have a thing that turns markdown into html. And have special tags that generate web components to generate things like the visual above (green border for correct iteration of a message). This would greatly reduce iteration speed because then you don't have to edit an image in Figma when you want to update a message or something. But this is definitely overkill and I should NEVER do this. lol.

**Landing page**
- https://shiftnudge.com/#reviews (woah)
- Have a section to showcase the visual design in the playbook (this is a major selling point. Encapsulate each "major" point in a diagram and showcase in this section of the landing page) - do this AFTER the beta reader feedback. Amen.
- Emphasize that recruiters chimed in on the playbook (and they did! I had at least 5 - 10 conversations with recruiters in 2019 about this).
- https://rauno.me/ ... omg, the font, the background color, spacing. It oozes a premium feel. I'm in love with it. Amen.
- https://twitter.com/cristicrtu/status/1530986605862952961?s=20&t=mMNYmTuiz3FVi0DDqhPZQA (study their thought process on how they designed their site. Could use some principles for this playbook presentation).
- https://twitter.com/splinetool -> 3d animation that can be controlled with user input: scroll / with cursor.
- Another thought is to have the book open up on scroll down from the hero. This is good in that it gets straight into it. I actually really, really like this. Damn... hmm... need to think about that experience.

**Fonts**
- https://klim.co.nz/buy/soehne/
- https://paco.me/ (the above font is in this site)

**Search** (obv not for the playbook, but once there is enough content):
- https://cmdk.paco.me/ (Using hte command+k interface to search for any piece of content that I've created. This would be powerful).
