**To talk about**
- Rename "Approach" to "Outreach". 
- Tooling: walking through the Notion template for the CRM (that readers can duplicate). I think this goes in the "approach" section, as its own chapter (or part of an "Intro" chapter).
- It's important for readers to understand the different types of Tech companies and how they differ in what they look for (e.g. Big Tech vs. startups vs. legacy tech companies -> IBMs, SAPs of the world). -> Bec. the game plan is honestly different. Another route is to narrow the scope of the playbook to ignore legacy tech (or perhaps a disclaimer that talks about how).
	- This definitely needs to be in "How companies hire" -> Go into decent depth there and reference that section in other areas. (I want # link to each header of this playbook - for more specific linking to the right sections).
- **Steering conversation**: I think I'll talk about this in the "in-person approach". An important general philosophy on how to approach any conversation really. A fascinating topic.
- **Tighten the scope of the audience**: only look to help those that can build a basic CRUD app. Those that can't even build this should first build themselves up this way before I'm able to help them.
- Rework "projects" chapter w/ far more hand holding. It's too intimidating as it stands right now.
- Have to explain how to choose most impressive past work. That's tough to do, and currently I haven't even talked about how that decision is made.
- Using your GPA / previous accomplishments unrelated to engineering could be useful in demonstrating competence - in the absence of more relevent engineering experiences. Need to address this somewhere. Definitely in one of intro chapters: it needs to clearly communicate 
- You don't need to build a "hard" technical problem to be impressive in the eyes of companies. Value = the use it provides others, NOT how difficult it was to build. You must adjust mental model of what is valuable to this.
- Special projects: https://twitter.com/pie6k/status/1606371846219304961?s=20&t=SKoB2GzGXpdEmxtlUbi4_w (really cool.)
- The power of writing essays: https://perell.com/podcast/patrick-mckenzie-internet-famous/ 
	- "But if the only thing you got out of writing an essay about whatever the topic is for you is that the next time you’re doing a job search when you are writing cold emails to hiring managers for whatever the position is that you’re going after, you can use that one essay that you wrote back in the as a proof-of-work on like, “Hey, I have clearly thought about this more than most people who are sending you a cold email with a link to a resume that you’re gonna skim for 30 seconds.” -> this is genius.

**Visual**
- **Visual language for textual analysis** - want to use this throughout the playbook (esp in the Resume, cold emailing, warm introductions sections). This is absolutely essential to analyze sentences well.
- https://getcoleman.com/ -> incredible way to present a morphing pitch. Might make sense to steal this format. If not, then at least present it in a beautiful way (Figma export rather than just as text in the page. Emphasize each pitch version and make it look beautiful).
- https://twitter.com/nandafyi/status/1605975563902279681?s=20&t=heu7sezE4zpfErjD8P04hA -> Amen. More Framer Motion genius.

-> This is a neat interface to show an improvement. Can use for something like explaining cold email messaging, etc.: by starting with a bad example, and iterating on it to something solid.

- When it's time to actually build out a custom reading experience (only after many iterations w/ a simple Gitbook draft), will want to be able to embed a Notion template in the middle of the article. E.g. like at the bottom of: https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/how-to-run-openais-whisper-speech-recognition-model/ (there's an embedded Airtable).
	- And "ideally" would have a thing that turns markdown into html. And have special tags that generate web components to generate things like the visual above (green border for correct iteration of a message). This would greatly reduce iteration speed because then you don't have to edit an image in Figma when you want to update a message or something. But this is definitely overkill and I should NEVER do this. lol.

**Landing page**
- Have a section to showcase the visual design in the playbook (this is a major selling point. Encapsulate each "major" point in a diagram and showcase in this section of the landing page) - do this AFTER the beta reader feedback. Amen.
- Emphasize that recruiters chimed in on the playbook (and they did! I had at least 5 - 10 conversations with recruiters in 2019 about this).
