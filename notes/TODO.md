**To talk about**
- Tooling: walking through the Notion template for the CRM (that readers can duplicate). I think this goes in the "approach" section, as its own chapter (or part of an "Intro" chapter).
- It's important for readers to understand the different types of Tech companies and how they differ in what they look for (e.g. Big Tech vs. startups vs. legacy tech companies -> IBMs, SAPs of the world). -> Bec. the game plan is honestly different. Another route is to narrow the scope of the playbook to ignore legacy tech (or perhaps a disclaimer that talks about how).
	- This definitely needs to be in "How companies hire" -> Go into decent depth there and reference that section in other areas. (I want # link to each header of this playbook - for more specific linking to the right sections).
- **Steering conversation**: I think I'll talk about this in the "in-person approach". An important general philosophy on how to approach any conversation really. A fascinating topic.
- **Tighten the scope of the audience**: only look to help those that can build a basic CRUD app. Those that can't even build this should first build themselves up this way before I'm able to help them.
- Rework "projects" chapter w/ far more hand holding. It's too intimidating as it stands right now.
- Have to explain how to choose most impressive past work. That's tough to do, and currently I haven't even talked about how that decision is made.
- Using your GPA / previous accomplishments unrelated to engineering could be useful in demonstrating competence - in the absence of more relevent engineering experiences. Need to address this somewhere. Definitely in one of intro chapters: it needs to clearly communicate 
- You don't need to build a "hard" technical problem to be impressive in the eyes of companies. Value = the use it provides others, NOT how difficult it was to build. You must adjust mental model of what is valuable to this.

**Visual**
- **Visual language for textual analysis** - want to use this throughout the playbook (esp in the Resume, cold emailing, warm introductions sections). This is absolutely essential to analyze sentences well.
- https://getcoleman.com/ -> incredible way to present a morphing pitch. Might make sense to steal this format. If not, then at least present it in a beautiful way (Figma export rather than just as text in the page. Emphasize each pitch version and make it look beautiful).
- https://twitter.com/nandafyi/status/1605975563902279681?s=20&t=heu7sezE4zpfErjD8P04hA -> Amen. More Framer Motion genius.

**Landing page**
- Have a section to showcase the visual design in the playbook (this is a major selling point. Encapsulate each "major" point in a diagram and showcase in this section of the landing page) - do this AFTER the beta reader feedback. Amen.
- Emphasize that recruiters chimed in on the playbook (and they did! I had at least 5 - 10 conversations with recruiters in 2019 about this).
