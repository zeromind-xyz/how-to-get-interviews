**To talk about**
- It's important for readers to understand the different types of Tech companies and how they differ in what they look for (e.g. Big Tech vs. startups vs. legacy tech companies -> IBMs, SAPs of the world). -> Bec. the game plan is honestly different. Another route is to narrow the scope of the playbook to ignore legacy tech (or perhaps a disclaimer that talks about how).
	- This definitely needs to be in "How companies hire" -> Go into decent depth there and reference that section in other areas. (I want # link to each header of this playbook - for more specific linking to the right sections).
- **Steering conversation**: I think I'll talk about this in the "in-person approach". An important general philosophy on how to approach any conversation really. A fascinating topic.

**Visual**
- **Visual language for textual analysis** - want to use this throughout the playbook (esp in the Resume, cold emailing, warm introductions sections). This is absolutely essential to analyze sentences well.
- https://getcoleman.com/ -> incredible way to present a morphing pitch. Might make sense to steal this format. If not, then at least present it in a beautiful way (Figma export rather than just as text in the page. Emphasize each pitch version and make it look beautiful).

**Landing page**
- Have a section to showcase the visual design in the playbook (this is a major selling point. Encapsulate each "major" point in a diagram and showcase in this section of the landing page) - do this AFTER the beta reader feedback. Amen.
- Emphasize that recruiters chimed in on the playbook (and they did! I had at least 5 - 10 conversations with recruiters in 2019 about this).
