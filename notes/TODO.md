**Visual**
- **Visual language for textual analysis** - want to use this throughout the playbook (esp in the Resume, cold emailing, warm introductions sections). This is absolutely essential to analyze sentences well.
- https://getcoleman.com/ -> incredible way to present a morphing pitch. Might make sense to steal this format. If not, then at least present it in a beautiful way (Figma export rather than just as text in the page. Emphasize each pitch version and make it look beautiful).

**Landing page**
- Have a section to showcase the visual design in the playbook (this is a major selling point. Encapsulate each "major" point in a diagram and showcase in this section of the landing page) - do this AFTER the beta reader feedback. Amen.
- Emphasize that recruiters chimed in on the playbook (and they did! I had at least 5 - 10 conversations with recruiters in 2019 about this).
